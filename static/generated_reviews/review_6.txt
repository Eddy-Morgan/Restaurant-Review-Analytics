Relatively inexpensive and pretty good food as well. ??We had the carne deshilada and some pupusas, &amp; all was pretty good. ??Worth a visit if youre in the area.

Came in on a Friday night. The place was pretty busy but we were sat immediately. The place is small but in a cute cozy way. Only about a dozen tables. I ordered the shrimp platter and my sister got the carne asada and a pupusa.   The shrimp was delicious and well spiced. The rice wasnt good to me and it was oddly sticky. The tortillas werent anything to write home about. I did have to add a little hot sauce to my tacos. The like served with it gave it a bright spot with the acidity. My sister didnt like her carne asada but loved the pupusa.   Service was very slow but the people were nice. But I dont think Id return because shrimp isnt enough reason to me.

The food and service wasnt the greatest.  There was a slight language barrier when placing my order. They also were out of a lot of stuff but only told us after we ordered and paid. Today they were out of rice and one of the cheeses for the quesadilla.   The chorizo taco basically feel apart because of the juices of the meat. The meat wasnt that great but it did taste fresh. The chicken an cheese pupusa was ok and was a little more on the burnt side. The chicken quesadilla left a weird aftertaste.  After spending $14 for a lunch I didnt really like...I don think I will be back.

Im not Salvadoran or even Hispanic, so not sure how authentic my meal was, but Ive had my share of pupusas and street tacos.   Im taking everything in account in my rating, from service, cleanliness, menu and food.   My husband and I dont speak Spanish, but I can understand the basics. We have been mistaken a few times because of what we look like. Which is no big deal, esp knowing we are coming into a Hispanic restaurant. Anyway, we didnt feel out of place because its not like everyone that was in there was just staring at us and we were immediately greeted by a server who spoke to us in English. He sat us down and was polite. Later another server did come to us as well and spoke to us in Spanish and realized since we didnt respond to speak to us in English. I didnt take a star away from that. Just something I wanted to note.  I did take a star away from cleanliness. Mainly the floor. There were lots of plastic utensils, straw wrappers, crumbs, spilled food on the floor. The table we sat in had one of those kid blowers that you get from a kids birthday party, some crumbs and wrappers under our table. Our table was clean, but you can tell they didnt sweep under. I definitely stepped on some smashed yucca. One of the servers was taking empty dishes from a table and dropped a plastic utensil on the floor and just left it there. She didnt even come back to pick it up later or when she passed it again.   We didnt wait too much later from our food. My husband ordered a pork and cheese pupusa and a beef lengua (tongue -- dont knock it until you try it!) burrito. He enjoyed the burrito -- it was tasty and was filled with fresh veggies. I ordered two pupusas (luroco and pork and cheese) and two tacos (chorizo/sausage and beef lengua/tongue). The taco meat were yummy, I wish I got two of the beef tongues instead though since I liked the flavor in that better than the chorizo. I liked that the meat werent too finely cut or small portion-- they definitely had more portions. We actually chose to eat here since I wanted tacos and this was the closest where we were at. Unfortunately, their menu photo on their site didnt reflect the tacos that I got. I was given pupusa dough for my tortillas instead of regular soft tortillas for my tacos. So I had to fork and knife my tacos since the bread fell apart. I dont even know why they gave me that, no one explained and its part of my fault to not have asked. For some reason I just thought the soft tortillas in the picture I just imagined. But when we left, I saw the menu again and saw there was soft tortillas and not the pupusa dough used in tacos.  The meat on the tacos were good and did fill me up. I was full that I couldnt eat all my pupusas. I did eat a few bites at the restaurant and it was just OK to me. I expected more luroco in my luroco pupusa and the coleslaw that came with it wasnt as tasty as some other pupusa places Ive been too. So thats the other reason I took off a star-- in my meal.  I did want to try the beef soup that was on the menu, but I would have been too hot to eat that inside there. It wasnt too hot inside, but I did wish they had the air on. It felt like it wasnt on.   Would I go again? Yes, but it wouldnt be a place I crave to go. I would rather go to other pupuseria or taco spot. I cant get over the floors and how come I got pupusa dough for my tortillas.

First time I came here, I was anticipating what it would be like. We were seated right away and looked over menu. I got the carne asada, which wasnt flavored all that well. Tasted better when i added lime and cholula. I got a revuelta pupusa which was the best pupusa of my life. The service was a little slow. My sister and i noticed we got our food after a table came im after us. And getting the check processed took like 10 minutes. Id probably come back and try something different or order out

Cheap eats in a pleasant environment is what youll get here. They have a great variety of pupusas - all under $2.00 each. I had the loroco, because its not that often I have squash blossoms. I also had a cheese quesadilla which was just cheese, but the quacamole made it perfect.  I know most pupusas taste the same wherever you go, but the ones here are truly an authentic El Salvadoran experience. Ive had ones the parents at my school make, and these are the real deal.  Its down the street from my friends house, so I will be back with her. Theres lots of free parking in the strip mall lot.

Some of the best tacos Ive had on the east coast. Amazing flavor and so reasonably priced. Next time Im in college park Im definitely coming back. Its a great place for families and great service

Great salvadorian place! Very authentic, tasty food and good prices.  Pupusas price range around $1.5-2 each. Entrees $8-10. You can eat your meal there in less than $10. Their pupusas are great, as well as the guacamole! also, I would recommend taking sliced mango. Yes, its just mango... but goes great with the food :)  One big disadvantage, though, is the fact they dont have liquor license - so no booze for me there... And also, if you care about the look of the place - this place is not for you.

Ive been here about 3-4 times and I would say the food is alright for me. Now, keep in mind that Ive only ordered pupusas and quesadillas from here as main entrees. Ive also had the papas locas which are delish.  For the pupusas, I LOVE the cheese and jalape??o pupusa, its my favorite there. I once ordered the combination pupusa that has everything in it, but it was dry and didnt really taste like much. The loroco, cheese and jalape??o pupusas are good.  The chicken/steak quesadilla was good when I ordered it first, but the second time around was not as good.  The service was nice, although the place gets crowded on weekends and you might have to wait a while to find a table. The parking is also a hassle sometimes, as there are more businesses around the shopping center and you have to wait for a space to open.

You cant beat the price for the food. Everything is delicious especially the pupusas. They were out of the two that I really wanted to try so I have to get my third and fourth try which were still delicious. This place is very authentic dont come here expecting burritos and the American version of Mexican food. I go to school across the street so I will be coming back here often.

Can I say just how quickly this place has skyrocketed to the top of my local favorites list?!  1. Theyre community-oriented. My daughters school had several restaurant fundraisers this year, mostly with chains. Pupuseria La Familiar is one of 2 independent restaurants who partnered with the PTA for a fundraiser. ??Not only that, but they were incredibly helpful throughout the entire process.  2. The food is just too good. I generally come for the pupusas, which are delicious! But I tried the tamale de gallino. So, so, so delicious! ??This has become my lunch spot - service is quick and the food is really inexpensive. ??I love that I can get 3 tamales and a side of rice for $8. There was so much food that I had leftovers. ??  Every time I come here, I find another reason to love it more. They will continue to get my business!

I used to love this place. Then I got good poisoning TWICE. I always get the same thing steak and chorizo tacos, a bean and cheese pupusa and a revelta pupusa. Last two times I have been sick. I will go back to the place in Hyattsville..

Really good, cheap, authentic food. The bathroom is disgusting so dont bother, but the restaurant is clean and the staff are nice. They have a couple of big screen TVs with everything dubbed in Spanish. I wouldnt recommend this place if you are in a rush, but call ahead and get take out - it reheats really well in the oven.

Great food! Authentic! Big portions! Best Salvadoran food in MD! Wendy was a great server

The food is good, but the service is HORRIBLE!!! I totally just recommend to order your food and take it home with you, because the service is MEDIOCRE, they always have an excuse about how they forgot to bring your drinks or the tortillas.

Pupuseria La Familiar is my neighborhood go-to for pupusas and other tasty Latin foods. Its one of my favorites in College Park, a cheap tasty restaurant with interesting, non-chain food. Im thrilled that its lasted a while in CPs volatile market.   Obviously, pupusas are a big draw here. Theyve got a nice selection - some with meat and some without. Im loco for the queso con loroco, which have a flavorful herb mixed with the cheese. One warning - they usually give dine-in customers plastic flatware and the fresh pupusas are so hot, theyll melt your fork! Im never patient enough to avoid a mangled fork. The slaw and sauce served with pupusas are delicious and generously portioned. I tend to use both as condiments on all my food.   But pupusas are only one part of the menu, and many other parts shine. I enjoy their tacos, especially the lengua (tongue), which are flavorful and piled high with meat. My other favorite at this place is their plantains. I can never get them so sweet, soft, and yet crispy at home! You can get these as a side, as an appetizer with retried beans and crema, or - my favorite - in the Plato Tipico, a platter with eggs, beans, plantains, crema, queso fresco, and a small baguette.   Meals are quite a deal here, as our two-person usual of a taco, two pupusas, and a Plato Tipico runs under $20 and is plenty of food for us. They have tempting beverages and desserts, if you manage to make room. We rarely do.   The missing star is due to service, because this place can be exceedingly slow for a cuisine thats generally quick to prepare. They sometimes seem understaffed during predictably busy periods, and then service suffers more. Waitstaff are also hit or miss on friendliness - none have been rude, but some are much more attentive and helpful than others.

Great pupusas. I make sure to stop here every time I visit my old college friend down in Maryland.

Went here for the first time yesterday and had taquitos, tacos (steak, chorizo, and chicken) , and a pulapusa (chicken) with a horchata drink! ??The dual flour tortilla on the tacos were wonderful and probably made the tacos the favorite item that I ordered on the night! the taquitos were tasty but not extra ordinary. Of course me and my dinner company had to try papusas, which I tried the spinach one and the chicken one. The papusas were yummy! The only thing lacking from this dinner experience was the waitress forgetting about our horchata drinks.

Such great food. Make sure to try all the pupusas. So tasty and really full of flavor. Also the desserts are amazing as well!!!

Pupuseria La Familiar makes promising, great authentic pupusas and they are also reasonably cheap. My favorite choice for pupusas are the jalapeno pupusas which are made to full satisfaction. As for the drinks, they have a good selection of latin beverages here too, including the thirst quencher, horchata.   The service is here is favorable. Id recommend this place to anyone and any college student whos tight on budget. Theres plenty of food to grub on without going over ten dollars.

Cheap and delicious and filling! We got five pupusas (total was just about $9)-- my favorites were the loca one, which had a mix of basically every filling, as well as the bean and cheese and jalapeno and cheese. The ayote/squash one didnt seem as flavorful, and the chicken one had just a weird mealy-ish texture that I didnt love that much.   Service was a bit slow, especially when we wanted our check at the end. The place was pretty packed even around 2 p.m. on a Sunday.

Seemed like pretty authentic Salvadoran food, and was delicious and cheap (less than $10).

I ordered the quesadilla to go and it taste amazing. I would have given it five stars but I didnt get the guacamole that came with the meal. Kinda disappointed because I was craving it. It came with sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes(not really pico de gallo)

Ive been coming to this restaurant for years. I figured its about time I write a yelp review. Lets start off with the staff. Staff is friendly and nice. Even when it gets busy they still remember to check on me, which I LOVE!   My all time favorites are the shrimp with cheese and jalape??o with cheese pupusas, chicken salad, and the mixed burrito. The pupusas have an even balance of both meat/veggie and cheese and it goes perfect with the salsa verde. The chicken salad is energizing full of veggies, chicken, and cheese. Lastly, the mixed burrito is loaded with flavor.   Overall, every time I go everything comes to a reasonable price. You can get a full meal with a drink under $10 and its not fast food, its homemade. Yum!   There is a downfall. It gets busy on the weekends which can be a little frustrating. I did find out they just opened a second location which I need to try.

A great find in college park. Authentic pupusas with lots of other offerings. Highly recommend this place to get a taste of El Salvador.

This was a magnificent find thanks to Yelp. We rode down to University of Maryland College Park to visit our son over the weekend and in searching for a new place to eat this restaurant came up on the search. We ordered a few different things to try some new items, we had the Carne asada, different pupusas (jalape??o, chic &amp;cheese, beef &amp; chic), a shredded beef dish and it was all very tasty. Service was friendly and the food came out hot. My least favorite part is that the utensils are plastic and they do not have a liquor license.

So I went to this restaurant with some friends and I ordered a couple pupusas and a glass of water. They brought me a glass of water which was dirty and I told the waitress if she could give me a new cup and she never came back until I called her back. The food took about 30 minutes and they didnt bring our food together it was spaced out by 5-10 min each and the staff didnt look friendly they barely came to check if we needed anything. The food was okay. Probably wont come here again.

So yummy! Great variety of food options. Helpful staff that helped us navigate menu options we werent familiar with. Really reasonable prices. Very fresh, hand-made food. Definitely glad we found this strip mall gem so close to home.

The food here is outstanding! ??The soft, airy tortilla used for tacos are soooo delish! ??The carne used in the tacos is marinated and grilled to perfection. ??The pupusas......best Ive ever had!!!!! ??I am in heaven!!!!

Been here a few times. Amazing. Authentic. Fresh. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!! Good portion sizes. They can work on not acting so alarmed when a white person comes in though lol. I wont bite ??as long as the food is good right?? Yesss. Dont let the white people know about this place!! ??lets keep it our little Latina secret

One Cheese Pupusa and One Pork Pupusa is all required for me. At first taste, I was sold. I will return. There were no seats available so I opted for take-out. I work as a construction inspector in DC and speaking to one of my crew members about how much I love Pupusas, he recommended this spot. Great atmosphere, great food.

Yelp got me here. ??Yes, I would not have discovered or even tried this place without you Yelpers. ??Having said that, it seems highly overrated. ??Meat was leathery tough (both steaks and chicken) and had no unique flavor. ??Sausage was moist and delicious. ??Tortilla was thick and kind of wet. ??Maybe I came at closing or they had a bad day when I shown up. ??I wont be back. ??Being my first Salvadorian experience, I will not let this place influence me to try other ones, just this one.

4 stars for amazing food and value.  As a curious, hungry college student that lived across the street from this place, I had to try it out. That beautiful day came 2 years ago.  I love the chicken tamale (I get ~8 and freeze them for exam weeks). They are so good I could talk about them all day. The best thing here has GOT to be the tacos! They come with a magical green sauce that makes everything in the world ok again. Spicy, creamy, fresh, fantastic. I love the lengua tacos but a more healthy, lo-cal option is the chicken tacos, Comes with a slice of avocado as well. The next best thing on the menu is the shrimp pupusa (try it before you knock it) and pupusa revuelta. Shrimp pupusa has chopped shrimp in it and goes PERFECTLY with the green sauce. So cheesy and savory. Revuelta is pork, bean, and cheese also fantastic with salsa. All pupusa dishes come w/ cabbage and salsa!  Things I wouldnt try again are the desserts and the mondongo soup. I just wasnt a fan of them but wanted to try them out for the heck of it.  Service is excellent, the ladies that work there are sweet, but they make the pupusas by order (which is why they are hot, cheesy, and all around awesome) so they will take awhile coming out. Worth the wait. Order some apps to keep your jaws busy.  Parking lot right in front.

This restaurant is located near UM off of Baltimore avenue. They are extremely professional and the food is absolutely amazing! I recommend the Carne Asada!

Totally wallet friendly little Pupuseria in College Park. I had a 3 pupusa meal for under $10 bucks the other day. The pupusas were fresh, savory, and filling. I had their bean and cheese pupusa, the jalapeno and cheese pupusa, and the chicken and cheese---all were delicious. Very casual spot but a great place to grab a quick, unpretentious, bite.

I come from a salvadorian family who appreciates pupusas and likes to support local family businesses. So naturally I had to see what La Familiar was about.  First, these pupusas are gross! ??I have gone twice to dine in. My first experience was pleasant because of the waitress (no idea what her name was) but my food was salty and not good. Not even my friend enjoyed his steak dinner.  The place is worst! The restaurant is unsanitary and has no real character. I went to dine today and the male waiter had his finger dipped into the red sauce bowl! I cant begin to imagine what else he did to my food.  I dont think I can come back to this place or recommend it to anyone.

As a college student, always in the lookout for good food at low cost this place is a GREAT choice. I can say that every time I come (1-2 times a month) the service has always been great. The staff doesnt speak great English, but they do their best and I always do my best to speak Spanish. The pupusas are delicious and I love the tamales. If you are looking for a homey, authentic dining experience and good inexpensive food definitely give la familiar a chance!

They arent the best, but definitely edible. Their food has good taste, they taste fresh.

EVERYTHING IS AMAZING !!!!! been eating at this place for years ! come all the way from silver spring..the best in college park !!!  I absolutely love the carne asada..mixed burrito..quesadillas and pupusas !!! also the sopa de res (best Ive had) if you havent already tried it I recommend you do TODAY ! cant go wrong with anything !!!  the staff is great and friendly and youre never waiting too long for the food either.. I would give it 10 stars if I could !

We order to go took forever! ??My food waiting and the stupid waiter never called my name. When i got home one pupusa got a big ass hair inside nasty. Never came back!!

The food is excellent. I found myself thanking my friend several times for taking me there :). ??I had the sopa de res with the tortillas (soo good and handmade) and tried the chicken and beef pupusas. I ended up taking a lot home, it was very filling. ??Yeah, its bare bones (Styrofoam and plastic forks), and the place was really loud but it kind of added to the experience in a good way. ??If you arent feeling the scene, just order it to go! Its worth it.

You would never look at this place and think their food might be worth your buck, but dont judge this book by its cover;) The plantains with frijoles and crema are fingerlicking good. The sausage and chicken tacos are fresh and yummy. The many varieties of pupusas are delish cheesy goodness, and paired well with the picked cabbage slaw. For the value, this is five stars to me!  Funny story--We found this place after the sushi next door left us unsatisfied and still hungry. This pupuseria was our second dinner for the nite.

I was on the fence about coming to this place because of some of the mixed reviews I read, but Im so glad I did. My boyfriend and I came here pretty late on a Sunday and ordered a bunch of food. The yuca and guac were great starters, but the star of the show was surprisingly the vegetarian burrito. It was delicious and had an amazing cold cucumber salad in it which Ive never had before. In total we got chips &amp; guac, yuca, 3 pupusas, a vegetarian burrito, and a plato tipico (breakfast plate) for about $27! The prices were definitely right and we even left with a doggie bag full of leftover food. I will be frequenting this place my next 3 years at UMD!

Let me start by saying that my family is of Salvadoran descent and we love to go and support local Latin American businesses. So... came into this place thinking it was going to be amazing and was sorely mistaken. the reviews are pretty awesome and my dad has gone a few times and had said it was satisfactory. We arrived to the restaurant and we were greeted by very unfriendly staff. It was freezing inside the restaurant. When we got out of the car it said 48 degrees on the dashboard. why was the AC blasting? the place wasnt crowded and the people that were in there, were wearing their coats. The waitress gave us menus, took our drink orders and left. Never said good morning or anything. I asked the waitress if they could please turn off the air conditioning, it was freezing. She looked at me blankly. I let it go. It took about 5 minutes to get the first coffee to our table. It took a total of about 20 mins to get 3 cups of coffee, two orange juices and a cup of hot water. Why would it take so long? There is no kids menu, so you have to make up an order for your kids, which is fine but when the waitress was asked if there was ??separate menu for kids, another blank stare. The staff clearly needs some customer service training and also to learn the menu. Had the waitress simply said something like, there is no kids menu but you can choose something from the extras menu and put something together that way, she would have gotten a better tip.  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular.  Overall it was a horrible experience. Clearly, the staff and owner dont care about their patrons because otherwise they would have tried to be more accommodating.  Next time, well spend our money elsewhere.

Fantastic food, I had the yucca Frita, tamales, Pupusas, and some chicken enchiladas, all fantastic!!!  Service could have been better

I have been coming to this place for quite a while now and I must say I love coming here. Im just yelping about it now because I am excited that they have a second location closer to me now in Langley Park. Its in the supermarket so now I can eat and then do some of my grocery shopping ...yay.  The food has always been good. Service has always been good. I dont go there as much only because it was far for me. But now that they have a second location Ill be going there more.  I love the variety of pupusas they have. The meals are always on point. I go there for the sopa de res, the chicken platter and steak platter are some of my favorite dishes there. My family enjoys the variety of dishes they have.  I always recommend La Familiar to my friends and family. Probably one of the best if not the best place for pupusas around. I have tried other locations but there is always something missing. I would give it a 5th star only if I lived closer to College Park or if they moved down the street from me. So a 4.5 ??it is. .Lol.

Puposaria la Familia serves some of the most affordable and filling good of good quality in College Park. Bean and cheese puposas are cheap and good; and very filling if you eat the cabbage too. Their chicken tacos are also quite delicious, with fresh avocado, queso fresco, and homemade pico de gallo on a soft corn tortilla. Super yum! Puposas are only $1.50, and tacos are $3 each. Its 1000x better than the sludge they serve across the street at Toxic Smell.  One thing, though. Its seriously no frills... The dining area is basic, and under decorated. Take out comes in styrofoam boxes, with salsa tied up in a plastic bag.  If they spent a little $$$ on decorating the dining area, obtaining a liquor license, and serving things in biodegradable containers, they could charge 2x the price and be a dining destination.

This is the best place for pupusas in the area  They are so yummy and the service is really nice  But this is my favorite place in college park

Whats with all the love for this place? These are some of the worst pupusas Ive ever had. I tried a bunch of different varieties but none of them were as good as I had hoped. Theyre incredibly cheap, but now I know why.

Super authentic and delicious food. The pupusas are really cheap and tasty, and we paired them with a side of plantains and beans and had quite a lot of food. We also ordered the carne asada and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly! I would definitely recommend it, and the fact that every table was full at 4:45 when we got there is a testament to that. You also know its good because almost everyone eating there was Latin :)

This place is nasty one of my friend found Cockroachs in her soup and they just acted like it wasnt a big deal.

delicious food! the service here is reliable and fast.  their pupusas are the best! my personal fave is the bean and cheese !  they have take-out as an option.

4 stars for the wide variety of papusas. Theres 10 different kinds here, and if one considers that each may be ordered as corn or rice based, then theres 20.  The jalapeno and the shrimp papusas only appeared on the to-go menu, ??but they can be ordered while dining in as well.   I suppose theres different takes on curtido (the slaw) thats served on the side. This one is somewhat plain, but also served on the side is a thin tomato salsa, so in combination, they work.  The plantains were great, and so was the Maranon (Cashew Apple) fruit drink. It had a nice balance between tart and sweet.

Inexpensive, tasty, and convenient to campus. The pupusas are between $1-2 each, which means you can get a very filling meal by ordering three or four. They come with a bowl of shredded cabbage and sauce so you can dress them as you go, which means they wont get soggy sitting under the accents.  I went for a horchata to wash it down - pretty tasty, but not the best Ive had. I think it may have come from a larger batch of mix rather than being made on-site.   Next time Im back I think I may grab some antiojos from the case by the register - they looked pretty great, too.

Words cannot describe how much I love these pupusas. I have been to quite a few places in the area and the revueltas (pork, bean and cheese) take the cake. Solid across the board, not the fastest but well worth the wait.

Really great cheap pupusas.  I have not tried any of the other items. I have only tried the chicharron and revueltas pupusas. They were both really good. They managed to maintain some crispness even though I ordered them to go. The slaw that is served on the side is also pretty good.  This place gets 4 stars because of the high quality of the pupusas, and because its very cheap ($1.50 per pupusa).   Definitely will return for some cheap eats.

The yucca was fantastic; I like it better than potato. ??I didnt like the pupusa though. The pork was obviously greasy but I had to take some home for my man to taste.  But they may have a service problem.  I called on Wednesday to try a rice pupusa w/chicherones. ??The phone rang forever, no answer.   I talked Pupuseria La Familiar with an El Salvadorian co-worker who told me these were her favorite in the area. ??So Friday, I called again. ??This time I was able to place an order. ??Heres where things get tricky:  I ordered a pupusa and the chicherones with yucca. ??In all of their online menus, the pupusa is $ 1.50 and the pork was $ 4.75 or something like it. ??With tax, total cost should be something like $ 7. ??I paid something like $8. ??But the staff was so... rude, a little, but that isnt the right word... indifferent or disconnected is better, I paid and left. ??  Maybe tightening my Spanish skills will help if there is a next time...

Had the steak cana sada was goodie portion papuosa was good also.if I was in the area I would return .but I wouldnt buy sour cream $2.00 or avocado $2.00 for half .

Whats that; Havent had a pupusa? Well if you are planning to eat here and try a pupusa or 2 you are in for a treat. Im sure there are better out there, but the ones here are delicious little cheesy filled delights for $1-2 a piece. The first time I had one was here and I couldnt wait to go back for more. I am only rating the pupusa, though they have much more food on the menu, and the for that, its a solid 4 stars. The service is nice and family run, but their English is horrid and I am still not sure what the spicy Cole slaw stuff is for. Ask for the salsa Verde if you like hot!

Ive had better pupusas to be honest. The wait is very long and service is just okay... I will say that the fried yuca is very good though

so when i first walked in it was a 5 star. place looked clean, we got waited on right away when we sat down. the food took a while to come out, we got fried fish, came with yellow rice and side salad and 2 tortillas. the side salad was just your average lettuce, nothing special. the rice was good. the fish tasted good but was a bit too soggy, i like my fish a bit more dry. the meat of the fish fell right off so made me think its been frozen for a while. That made me go down to 4 stars. then to 3 stars when the waiter didnt even come back to ask if we needed refills or needed anything else. then it took forever to get the bill and to leave the bill. place is too noisy with the music and people talking. that almost made me give this place 2 stars but overall id come back to try the other food.

La Familiar has the most delicious and varied pupusas Ive ever seen! Pork, chicken, jalapeno, shrimp, and so on. The prices are just right, the service expeditious, and the pupusas are fresh off the griddle.   Despite all of the fancy pupusas Ive tried, the pork and cheese is still my favorite! I would start with guacamole and just have a pupusa meal like gringas are want to do.

There are only so many choices in College Park and you could do worse than this place, Pupuseria La Familiar. The pupusas here are very cheap, and itll make for a decent meal.   The place is kind of dim, but its clean, at least cleaner than many other places in College Park. I got three pupusas: the revueltas, carne asada, and shrimp. When they came out, it was HOT, so be patience and wait a few minutes if you dont want to get burnt. Overall, they were all pretty tasty, and three will fill you up, if not two. The curtido or slaw which is served on the side was kind of dry and plain to me. I wasnt a big fan of it.   But overall, itll make for a decent cheap lunch, and you could do worse in this town.

The best Pupusas de pollo..however they did just change it so you have to buy more than one at a time. ??I was a good customer and I came in one night-only wanted a snack hence I ordered one and they told me I cant buy just one pupusa- even though it stated nothing of the sort on the menu. False advertising so I didnt like that but I will still give them <a href=/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F4stars.Best&amp;s=f43f470a791e6256d5b40a78cdd9eab83631c8026a12678119f5efe0c594739b rel=nofollow target=_blank>4stars.Best</a> Pupusas in College Park for sure. ??Their food looks good too. Nice people running counter.

Great prices and excellent pupusas. ??Very tasty. Service is great too as long as there is not a lot of customers!

This place is good. ??I do agree that the curtido could be a little better, but the pupusas and burrito that I had were very good. ??They also serve this homemade green spicy sauce that is soooooooo good (not for the pupusas). ??You can also buy a bottle for $3 as I did when I returned for carryout. ??  Clean place, nice staff, varied selection of pupusas and you can specify what flour (I have never encountered that before). ??With extremely limited decent dining options in the heart of College Park, your best bet is to hit up Pupuseria La Familiar!

Chicken tacos are excellent and the frijoles are the best Ive ever had. Excellent pupusas, their salsa verde is tops, and the food is fresh and made to order.

My first time here and I am already planning my return trip! I ordered 3 pupusas and because it was my first time here, I ordered them all different. As best as I can describe it, a pupusa is a filled pancake but much better! I think I like the combination one the best. It was filled with pork and refried beans. Delish! My meal came to $10 with a specialty drink! Its cheap &amp; tasty! Gonna go back and try other dishes!

Pupusas: cheap, tasty and filling. This little Salvadoran spot has some other stuff that may be good, but tender fat little pupusas are all I have ever gotten here, ??The curtido (coleslaw-esque side) isnt the best Ive had, but the competitors over on University in Langley Park are a long way off, and not necessarily any better.  Try the squash (ayote) or loroco (mild herb of some sort) and cheese if you are a vegetarian, or just dont want to get all meated up. And 2 of these (at $1.50 each!) will fill you up. Splurge with a Tamarindo to drink and you are still eating for about $5 after tax.

Fantastic Salvadorean food in the dining wasteland of College Park. ??DOnt let the strip mall ambiance fool you--this place serves the best pupusas within 5 miles in any direction. ??Other menu items are equally good--incredible fried yucca, great enchiladas. ??Super nice waitstaff.

Ive had carryout from here several times. Their pupusas are the only ones Ive ever tried, so I dont know how they might compare to other places, but they are pretty darn tasty. They are fresh, delicious, and inexpensive. Ive also had the platanos, which are a great complement to the pupusas.

This place is great! The food is so clearly homemade. As a college student, when I start craving a hearty love-filled meal, this is where I turn. You will get different service here than what you would expect, but this isnt a bad thing. Servers have limited ability to speak English, and it is very casual! I am not crazy about pupusas (Im not Salvadoran) but they have great classic Mexican style foods like burritos, enchiladas, carne asada, tacos, etc... You will be happy with anything you chose! Prices are good. Two people will leave with super full stomachs for under $20 (tip included).

One of the best (and cheapest) meals in College Park! Tonight I dined there with a party of four and, with three courses, the total bill was under $30. I cant speak to the entrees but the pupusas are fabulous! I generally pair two pupusas with an order of fried plantains. At these prices, you can afford to be adventurous. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is friendly, efficient and willing to answer questions if youre new to the cuisine.

I am Salvadoran and Ive tried so many pupuserias in the DC area that this one beats all of them. Try the mixed (revueltas) pupusas made from rice flour. They are really good. I have not tried other menu choices but by far their pupusas are the best.

Where else can you get a delicious, affordable sit-down meal in College Park? ??The menu is extensive and the service is friendly. ??I eat here whenever I can.
