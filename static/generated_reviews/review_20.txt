Pregame food before a night of drinking and we ordered: Chicken nuggets seaweed salad fries and two bubble teas dumplings  Every single item was so pleasing. I want to try everything on the menu.

This review is strictly for their boba drinks.   After a day visiting College Park, I was so happy to find a place that serves boba drinks! Interior was quaint and colorful, and the server was helpful and offered some drink suggestions. They have a wide selection of drinks. I decided on a coconut milk tea, which was made dairy free (yay). The boba was okay, but the drink itself was lackluster. It tasted bland and watered down. Maybe Im spoiled with having so many premium boba places in my local area (T4, Sharetea, Moo Moo, I-tea, etc.), but this place isnt up to their caliber.

If I was still in college, I could totally see myself going here all the time. Tasty, well-priced Asian food? Yes please.   If you love eel like me, the eel and rice is so satisfying. Im definitely getting that dish every time. Other good dishes to try = the chicken nuggets, beef stew, and sweet milk buns.   The boba is decent but if youre looking for just boba, Id prefer the Kung fu tea down the street.

I grew in LA, and the Ten Ren Tea restaurants there had a reputation of good food and great Bubble Tea. Im reviewing the following:  Fried buns w/condensed milk: its done correctly and really difficult to mess up. 4 stars.  Fried tofu: they no longer sell stinky tofu, a signature dish, so this was ordered instead. Again this was done well, crispy outside and soft inside, 4 stars.  Chicken nuggets: this is their best dish, well done, the only thing I would say is the breading isnt as uniform as it could be. 4 stars.  Pork cutlet (tonkatsu) with rice: the pork cutlet was over fried, and had a taste akin to that of pork jerky: hard to chew and very tough. 0 stars.  Shredded pork noodle: excellent portion, pork here was done well, noodle was a let down and too soft. 3 stars.   Overall this is a let down from the LA (San Gabriel) location, though their Bubble Tea is excellent. Come here for the drinks, for the chicken nuggets, but Id avoid the two dishes I ordered.

My friends and I waited 45 minutes before we received our orders. There were about 5-6 people who entered after we just were seated creating bubble tea orders to go. After an additional quiet time of about 15-20 more minutes for a grand total of 45 minutes or more, and only one person at our table receiving a plate order, Poor customer service. The other table adjacent to us received more service, while we waited. I felt like my time was squandered. This occurred on the weekend. We paid for quite a bit of time on the parking meter as well. I think I will decide not to come here if given the option, there is a potbelly next door that sells smoothies.

Enjoyed.  Not a huge selection of bubble tea in the Maryland area. But this was def one of the best that Ive gone to in MD.  They dont have a selection of boba... (cant find anywhere that does in MD)...  I love BUBBLE TEA!  If I am in the area- I will stop by for more boba tea.  The entrees were JUST OK!!! Nothing special but that isnt why I came here... I came her for TEA.

Im probably biased as a fellow Terp and have shared many memories here but I l.o.v.e. Ten Rens. Even as an alumnae, this is my go-to dinner spot whenever Im meeting up with someone in College Park. Now, I still havent tried everything on the menu but the entrees I always order (Beef Stew Noodle Soup, Chicken Nuggets with Rice, Fried Rice with Sausage) never let me down! I like getting the Delicacy Platter too if Im extra hungry. The bubble teas are delicious to me, Ive tried most of the flavors as well as their hot teas. The sweet Lavender or Rose flavored teas are on point! I guess if the lines too long, its not that worth it to stay and wait because theres plenty of other restaurants around but I still give Ten Rens my best rating!

The years go on and Ten Rens Tea remains a staple point in College Park. ??I was staying nearby and hadnt been here in forever. ??I remember when it use to only be half the space, before they remodel and expansion. ??Its good to see how rooted in the community this establishment has become. ?? The staff are very nice and the food is still decent enough. Go with the dim sum items, the steamed mana pua is good.

Service: The waiters and waitresses are a bit awkward. It also felt like they wanted us to leave every time they came over, even though they saw we were studying after we had ordered and eaten some of our food. Also, it wasnt as if there was a shortage of space for new customers. You would think they would appreciate us staying longer since we did order more food.  Drinks: We ordered a mango Boba smoothie, green apple Boba smoothie, mango matcha with mango jelly. The Boba smoothies both tasted like slurpees. The mango was great, but the green apple tasted like a Bath &amp; Body works shower gel with a strange after taste. My sister couldnt even finish drinking it. The Boba was also slightly undercooked. The mango matcha with mango jelly tasted good, but I couldnt really taste the mango aside from the mango jelly.  Food: We ordered green tea noodles with pork meat sauce, instant noodle soup, fried bun with condensed milk, and chicken nuggets. The green tea noodles with pork meat sauce was rather flavorless. I was confused that there seemed to be more tofu in it than pork. The instant noodle soup tasted like instant chinese ramen, but it was really salty and oily. The fried bun with condensed milk was ok, but not the best Ive ever tried. Overall, the food was average and somewhat bland. I would say the chicken nuggets would be the safest bet to order. The way they fry their chicken is with the same better as they would fry their sweet and sour pork. The seasoning they use is decent. But I would recommend driving to Jumbo Jumbo for their popcorn chicken instead.  I was pretty disappointed after visiting today even though I had seen the mixed reviews on yelp before trying it out. The Ten Ren locations in California are amazing! So I assumed this location would uphold the same standards. If you live near the area, its good in terms of pricing and convenience, especially for students. But if you live in DC or Virginia, its not really worth the drive. There are better places that I would recommend.

I am so disappointed. I ordered the honey milk green tea with boba. The large is $5! They only have a large or a small (which is really small)...what happened to medium??? The milk tea was too sweet and the tea was weak. Overall, my drink was bland. The Ten Ren in California is AMAZING so I was hoping that this would carry over to Maryland, but I was wrong. The quest for good boba continues...  I also ordered the Shrimp pancake. The price was decent and the portion is substantial. I would recommend this.

Almost two and a half stars. Unfortunately, they were unable to make either of the two drinks I was most interested in due to an outage of coconut-- unsurprising for the V.13 but not a listed ingredient for the yourple. Half a large Thai coffee had enough caffeine to keep me up for 8 hours. Just the right amount of dairy in the taro smoothie, so even without coffee jelly the drinks win me over more than the food. Not a fan of the fried buns with a light crust over white bread, doused with condensed milk. Crispy tofu was decent, lightly drizzled with garlic sauce and sriracha on the side instead of chili paste. The evenly fried delicacy platter included two cheese wontons (pass), a few fried fish balls (aight), and a majority of chicken nuggets (ok). Mango shaved ice was fine.  Service was lovely and attentive, greeting us shortly after arrival and doting on us regularly for water refills and the like. Comfy couch seating for two tables in the window, a few shelves of board games by the door (domino set is missing a few). I can imagine being a student nearby and studying here with a pot of tea and an occasional snack at reasonable prices. The authentic Taiwan section of the menu just points out the weirder cultural signatures. Uncensored hiphop streaming over the speakers. Might come back when they arent low on ingredients to also try the pork / red bean / taro buns, takoyaki, pu-erh beef stew with noodle soup, or green tea noodle with pork sauce.

My trip Ten Ren was a questionable experience. I ordered the ground pork on rice and boy oh boy I was disappointed...They have about 90% white rice and 10% ground pork. The ground pork included little cubicle pork fat which I was not happy about. I dont understand why the ground pork would include little fatty pieces? Next I order the pan fried chicken noodles. It was not even pan fried!! It was plain as hell and again, not much meat and all noodles. Like 80% noodles and 20% chicken. The bubble tea was okay, my only complaint was the bubbles were too sweet for me. The only good thing we order was the appetizers: chicken nuggets. But the chicken nuggets had too much flour. Waited forever for the dishes like 20 minutes and the waitress was kinda nervous and clumsy which got my first order wrong.   Waste of time and money, never go here if you want some bad, plain Chinese food.  The only reason why this place is still in business is that its next to the University. If it wasnt near the University, I wouldnt be surprised if the place goes out of business.

There are a lack of boba tea locations in the Maryland area unlike other places that I have been to such as California, New York, &amp; Toronto. I would have to say that Ten Rens Tea Time is one of the best boba tea restaurant in the Maryland area that I have tasted. They have a reasonable good selection of boba tea for a decent price. However, they did not have the flavor that I was interested in, which was avocado. As a result, I went with the peach boba tea. The tapioca bubbles was made made to perfection. The peach flavor was good but not my favorite. The staff were nice and accommodating. The place was clean and had a quiet environment. I would definitely come back here when my friends and I want some boba tea.

Ten Ren is the place to go for yummy chinese food and delicious bubble tea.  Ive been going to this place for the past 10 years. Their bubble tea never fails to amaze me. Their beef stew noodle soup is on point! The tender beef will melt in your mouth and the spicy broth will keep you warm. This is a great local business (mom / pop shop).  They recently opened a Kung Fu Tea business across the street. Ive been to that place a few times, however they cannot replicate the love and time that Ten Ren puts in their drinks. Plus, Ten Ren is a great place to study as it is not noisy and a very intimate place if you want to go on dates and or go with friends.  They also have delicious chicken nuggets there. Not too much breading and with tons of meat.   Drink-wise, definitely try their classic black milk tea, thai iced coffee and macha green tea. Also, their Bubbles are FREE unlike Kung-Fu Tea which charges you for them. Why pay for something when you can get it for free at Ten Ren.  Whether you come here for a snack, drink and full meal, you will get great service and excellent food.

I like this cute hyper-Chinese spot in College Park. Theres a big menu of different boba tea flavors and theyre all delicious. The bobas are cooked to chewy perfection.   As far as the food menu, I like their takoyaki and their pork dumplings. Everything else is ok. Service is very friendly but also very slow. Good spot for students.

My friends and I ordered the crispy tofu, fries, the chicken nuggets, and the Chinese sausage fried rice - all of which was good! The chicken nuggets came with a sauce which was really good. We ordered it on the side instead of on top of, just in case the sauce would make it soggy.   As for the drinks, the Thai Coffee just tastes like drip coffee from Starbucks with tapioca... Nothing Thai about it. Another one of us ordered the Taro smoothie tastes extremely artificial. The drinks also came about 10 minutes after our food came out, which brings me to the next part of this review: the service.   Id rate the service here a 6/10. Everything came out really slow. The people arent the friendliest but they also arent rude or anything. And overall, the food is better than the Bubble Tea. I would come back though for the convenience.

This place is very meh to me. If youre craving slightly above average Chinese food then youll love Ten Rens.   The food is either really bland or really salty and their chicken nuggets are so battered I can barely find the chicken in each piece. Their prices are also really inflated for mediocre food. The udon is always lukewarm when I get it which makes the noodles seize up and taste like paste when I eat them and their appetizers are just MEH.  Overall, really average food thats definitely not worth the price or hassle of going to. Id rather walk to Wasabi if I want bubble smoothies or tea.

Im an addict with their honey green tea with bubbles. the teas are made just right and their bubbles are the best. its chewy and really gooey. I cant say enough. please go there and try their bubble teas and foods as well. super crispy chicken nuggets that give your tongue extreme happiness.

I graduated from UMD almost 3 years ago and somehow Ive never checked out this place until a couple of days ago. I got the vanilla chai bubble tea and it was so delicious! Definitely one of my favorite tea flavors. However, the tapioca balls were a little too chewy for my liking.

Ten Rens Tea Time has some extremely good boba tea.  This place is obviously a popular study joint - tons of tables, table service, a pretty varied menu, etc. ??I cant speak to the food, but it looked to be pretty tasty. ??You have to get waiter service if you use a table, which is weird (I feel bad having someone just deliver drinks to me!), but not bad.  The bubble tea here is extremely good, both for MD and in general. ??I got the Japanese Green Tea bubble tea, which was light and refreshing without being overly sweet. ??The tapioca bubbles were perfectly cooked and slightly sweet and chewy, which is the exact texture that works the best for bubble tea. ??The price was also extremely reasonable, further sweetening the deal.  Frankly, this place has amazing bubble tea - highly recommended for that alone!

I love ten rens! I love their bubble tea and their food. Although you must be careful on what food you order. You never have to be careful on what bubble tea or hot tea you order here. All their tea options are delicious. Their bubbles are super bouncy and chewy. Their bubbles never get too hard despite the cold drink. My favorite tea is the rose honey tea. If you order this pot you can refill it with water and the rose flavor lasts for an extra brew. The floral sent of the rose tea is unforgettable. The honey they add to the tea takes it over the top.   The food is tricky because some of their food options are so satisfying yet, some of their dishes are not as good as you would expect. My favorite is their chicken nuggets. Their nuggets are a must when you eat here. Its a great pick me up snack or you pay a bit more and you can get it as a main course dish with rice. The nuggets have a spicy flavor and are loaded with different herbs and spices. On top of the great flavor, the nuggets are super crunchy and crisp. My least favorite dish is their sweet and sour pork. The sauce is way too sweet and way too overwhelming for my taste buds.

They have a wide range of teas which are nice. I ordered 2 bubble tea drinks and asked for half sugar, but it was still SO sweet.   Food, the beef stew was pretty good. I like the broth, not too salty. Big, tender chunks of beef. I was expecting nice chewy noodles, however, they were not. Also had the spicy Sichuan chicken dish. Did not like both the look or the taste. Not spicy at all, didnt really even taste like chicken, looked like it had fake red coloring. Dont order this!

Best boba tea ever! You have to come here to try some of their awesome teas. I love their black milk tea with bubbles. They also have a really tasty Thai tea. Their teas are sweetened perfectly and they have the softest most chewiest bubble ever.  Their small and large cups for their teas are significant changes in size. The small cup is tinyyy and the large cup jumps into a huge size. If you are contemplating between the two sizes, I would say stick with the large cup. Youll be happy you did!   I would recommend you to get the rose tea. It is slightly sweet and comes in a tea pot. The best part is that you can see roses floating in your tea pot! It is so adorable. Not only is it a pretty tea to look at, but it is also tasty and has a slight floral scent to it.   This place is definitely a place you go for their teas, but they also have decent food options.   This place has tasty chicken nuggets. They are chunks of chicken fried to perfection with the most crispy batter ever. It comes with a mayo base sauce and is a great appetizer to share with others.   I tried their beef stew with white rice and I would say it was decent. It has chunks of beef and cooked radish in a gravy sauce. The beef was kind of tough and radish added a nice sweetness to the dish.  The schezwan chicken was good, but I felt like the chicken wasnt real chicken meat. The meat was mushy and soft. Other than the texture, the meal was good.  Orange chicken is good for like the first three bites and then you quickly get sick of the sweetness.   This is a nice place to hang out with your friends and just sit and chat while sipping your tea!

Ive been here before and I tried their delivery service because I really needed some bubble tea. Hilariously when I got my order there was no straw. I tried calling the restaurant and they just said sorry we cant do anything. They couldnt contact the driver or send someone with anything else. I asked for a refund since I wouldnt be able to enjoy my drink. The girl on the phone seemed clueless and another girl in background told her a refund for a fucking straw?! Just with that I am immediately turned off from this place. This is the second time that theyve forgotten to send a straw along. At this point I should really order my own straws to have at home apparently.

Finally a return after a few years. ??On one occasion I had a special seasonal-flavor bubble milk tea whose name escapes me. ??It was dark colored and potent in flavor; I did not like it one bit. ??  On the other occasion, I had the taro bubble milk tea which was quite tasty and a favorite of mine. ??It is well executed here at Ten Ren. ??My companion had the Thai iced coffee bubble milk tea. ??I had a sip and didnt like it, it was too strong of a taste, but my companion seemed to be ok with it. ??We also had a meal which was composed of a vegetarian spring roll, steamed taro buns, orange flavored chicken with rice (my companion) and vegetarian udon soup (me). ??The spring roll was quite tasty and the buns an improvement from my first visit five years ago. ??My companion didnt care too much for the orange chicken, and I was disappointed by the udon soup. ??The veggies seemed to be mostly out of a can with more palatable broccoli and carrots. ??The udon noodles were good. ??The broth was extremely salty and the flavor was mediocre and I did not enjoy it. ??  I think Ten Ren is more of a place to enjoy tea and appetizers and not really have a meal. ??I will return for this purpose when in the area.

Really cute place for students! It seems crazy but I come all the way from Falls Church VA to here just to get a ??cup of lemon oolong tea with egg pudding and bubbles. Fish balls are also my favorite!! But if you wanna try many things, you should order a combination dish which has fish balls, cheese wonton, chicken nuggets, etc. Takoyaki is amazing !!! Must try !!!

Love there TEA!!!! Wide varieties and quick service. ??I always get the same thing green apple bubble tea!!!!!!

Im a huge fan of the bubble tea here, and usually find myself venturing forth to this place at least a couple times of month just to get one of their bubble teas. I like that they dont over steep their teas so it doesnt taste bitter. And I like that the bubbles have a light sweet taste to them. The bubbles also have a great chewy texture. I usually order the green tea with honey, but have tasted all three of their bubble teas (green, black, and oolong), and all have tasted pretty good. My favorite tea in general is oolong, and its rare to find a bubble tea place that offers an oolong option. This place also offers fruit smoothies and other flavors for the bubble teas, but since they dont use fresh fruit (they use the powder stuff), Ive never ordered it and dont imagine I would be a fan.   The food here is decent, but very americanized. The chicken is all fried, at least for the dishes Ive tried, including the kung pao chicken (even though its not typically supposed to be fried). The noodles here generally suck, sort of like that you would expect if you made your own noodles using a ramen pack, but the broths and sauces are generally flavorful. I wouldnt come here just for the food, but I do love the bubble tea enough to keep coming back. In my opinion, this is one of the best bubble tea places in the DC area.

A good place to get Asian drinks such as honey green tea and milk tea. I had tea boil eggs and popcorn chicken. Many students come here to study. The minimum charge per person is $3.4 which is actually just a drink. I have seen Worse. Lol

I went back to ten rens for a bubble tea. I used to come here before since this was the only place serving bubble tea near Umd that I knew of. But recently a few other places have opened up so there are options. This Friday evening I decided to go back to ten rens for their mango matcha bubble tea. The bubble tea was too dilute and had barely any matcha flavor. It was full of ice and watery. After having matcha drinks from nearby places recently this one felt pretty sad. Moreover the person who took our order was continuously pushing for us to order food. We had no intentions of ordering food here today. We just went for bubble tea and I made it clear the very first time he asked. Yet again he came back with a menu after some time to ask. I felt he was pushing too far and I just decided to leave right away. The place was nearly empty on a Friday night and I can guess why. I didnt try the food but the service annoyed me.

I got the Thai tea hot and it was a lot better than I expected The vanilla chai hot and black milk tea hot was also very good The green milk tea hot had a floral taste to it The drinks werent as sweet as I expected which was really like  Went 12/1 Monday night around 8 and it was fairly empty. Seemed to pick up a little more business around 9.   We also ordered the chicken nuggets and it came out hot and delicious like always.

Ive never ordered food here but the bubble tea is awesome! My favorite is mango black tea with bubbles. It is served without milk over ice. Peach green tea is also a good option! If youre a fan of black milk tea the vanilla black milk tea with bubbles is a great option.  Service is always very prompt and friendly! I usually get my tea to go but if you decide to stay there is a spacious seating area and several board games to play.

The food here is pretty good! The tofu is the best, ive never tried fried tofu as good as theirs!

A fun cafe type restaurant. Theres lots of foods to choose from but I definitely come here for the bubble tea. The bubble tea here is better than your average in this area, the flavors dont taste powdery and the bubbles are cooked to a perfection. My favorite here is the almond and taro. I like thai tea too, its comparable to what you would get at thai restaurants. The milk tea is delicious as well.   I like the cheese wontons and the chicken nuggets from here. The ambiance is friendly for hanging out with friends and studying (not during busy times).

Pretty mediocre. The complimentary water is nice in theory, but slightly yellow and tastes like rust. Parking is metered. The signs are poorly drawn on printer paper, but are at least funny (mango bench-pressing a waffle). Their bubble tea was sort of tangy, and the chocolate bubble tea tasted like powdered nesquik. Not bad, but not great.

Visited just for the bubble tea. There is a wide variety of unique flavors and options.

Im a regular customer here, and Ill say that if youre willing to wait an obscene amount of time, the food MIGHT be worth it for you.  The staff just doesnt cut it. For example, I just came to the restaurant this past weekend, hoping to get some food after a long day. I waited for 25 minutes, no Hello, havent been given a menu or had my table set. To top it all off, a family that came in 15 minutes after me got handed menus, utensils, etc. I dont care if the employees there dont enjoy their jobs or whatever the case may be, but you should take your customers in a timely manner and in the order they entered. If they keep this up, Im pretty sure many regular customers may start losing their patience with this establishment. Get it together

After dinner, we were craving bubble tea so we made a pit stop at Ten Rens Tea Time before making it back to our car. It was nice that there was a couch to sit on while waiting for our bubble teas. My friend got Strawberry Milk Tea with Bubbles. This is the first place that they actually use strawberry milk to make the bubble tea. I wonder if they get the milk from the creamery on the UMD campus. I got the Peach Tea with Lychee Jelly. It was good as usual.

Bubble tea review only: Ten Rens bubble/boba tea is fabulous. The bubbles are perfectly chewy, never hard, and slightly sweetened. I cant keep myself from coming here regularly. Only reason it doesnt get full stars is because they only have two sizes: Small and Large. The small is too small and the large is almost $6 after tax. Pretty darn expensive.

Favorite spot in College Park for boba aka bubble tea. ??The tapioca pearls are consistently cooked well which makes the drink. ??Taro is the favorite in our family, but Im really an ice coffee person. ??In the many years coming here, weve always had a great beverage.  Wait staff is great. ??I came in one day when they were short staffed... the employee at the cashier was also serving tables! but still very helpful. ??This past Sunday I came thinking they were open because of the info on Yelp. ??I arrived with staff still setting up, but with 15 min to go the employee offered I sit and wait in the air conditioning. ??She kindly apologized about the confusion even though she doesnt maintain Yelp and then took it upon herself to correct the info online.  As for food, weve had a few things like the chicken nuggets, green beans and tofu. ??Theres a theme with these choices sadly, but cant go wrong with fried food. ??Everything came out hot and seasoned well!

Ten Rens is a cute, quiet tea room with lots of different Asian dishes, though they are mostly a Taiwanese restaurant.  My personal recommendations include the hot tea (try the Ginger Oolong!), bubble tea (tons of options), and the vegetarian fried rice.  In the past, Ive gotten the Chicken Filet with Udon Soup -- the chicken was always cooked and flavored really well, but the most recent time I went the chicken was honestly rubbery. The rest of the soup was great, though. I dont know if this is a one-time fluke but Im ordering the fried rice next time...  Overall, nice place, great for a date or a casual lunch.

LOVE this place. Whether you pop in for a bubble tea to go or sit down for dinner I have always received excellent service and food. The food comes out insanely fast. And the prices are so affordable that you can order to your hearts desire.   The atmosphere here is also pretty chill. During the school year it gets pretty packed with students studying and doing homework (personally I dont know how they can concentrate here. Ive tried doing homework here but it gets a little loud and the free wifi can be a bit slow). They also have a selection of games you can borrow and two televisions I believe.   The last time I went I ordered the kung pao chicken with rice and it was really good. It was a large portion and I ended up taking half of it home. Ive also tried their steamed pork buns, tea boiled eggs, and seaweed salad -- all of which I would highly recommend.   For the bubble teas I recommend the vanilla chai or the thai tea bubble teas. I also recently tried the hot versions of the bubble teas and they were really good too -- huge size and perfect during the colder months. And dont forget to ask for a Ten Rens VIP card -- you get a stamp for every drink over $3 and after 10 stamps you get a free drink up to $3.25

Love Ten Ren!   Their food is delicious.  I personally enjoy their chicken nuggets as leftovers, there are much more tasty that way than fresh. Tokatsu was crispy wit a yummy sweet sauce.   And ofcourse, thai milk tea is da bomb.  Prices are definitely affordable, and although staff is limited, service is great and fast.  Great College Park spot.

I went to get food at TenRens and I had my friends with me who had Kung Fu Tea with them. I ordered carry out from them because I didnt think I was gonna eat there. When my food came, I decided to sit there and eat and talk with my friends. But one of the employees came over and said we can not have outside food or drinks(The Kung Fu Tea). He didnt want to only kick my friends out so he also mentioned how I ordered carry out and I shouldnt be eating it here. I was furious how I ordered food from them and I cant even eat at their own place? 10/10 would not go again.

A good place for a pot of hot tea and chats. We had orange tea and two shaved ices. The shaved ices are HUGE and topped with more than enough toppings, so make sure you have a good appetite for it.

This has been our go-to bubble tea place for almost 10 years. Also has a lot of good food, but the tea is really what theyre known for! Relaxed ambience inside as well

I love Ten Ren! I have been coming to this place for 10 years now and the bubble tea is the best Ive ever had. My personal favorite is the pineapple green tea. My husband really likes the vanilla chai milk tea. The food is also great too!

Food was great. The tea was amazing, BUT I give this place three stars. Although the food and tea were great, the service was horrible. It was not peak hour but we waited for about 10 minutes for the server to get to us.   After our server finally got our order, the food came out perfect and quickly, but follow up took forever. We wanted to order another pot of tea but instead we decided not to because no one would come over to our table. Even the lady behind us kept trying to call the server but no response.   We also had to get up and get the check ourselves because no server was on the floor. When we went up to the cashier we saw the server near the kitchen chatting with a friend.   If you want a good service choose the seats closer to the cashier or the kitchen area - you are more visible so youll get better service.

Food is decent - the teas and desserts are to die for. Great service as well. Get the mochi ice cream - you will not regret it!

This Ten Ren definitely isnt on par with the ones in California, unfortunately. I have been several times and leave feeling a little sad after each visit.  First two times I ordered the Earl Grey Milk tea. Both times the tea had been very weak and hardly sweet at all. My most recent visit, I ordered the black milk tea and it was almost too sweet. At most Ten Rens you can adjust the sweetness level so I dont know why they dont bother asking here. Boba was very soft this visit, but the other times, they had been a little on the medium soft side which is a-ok in my book. The shaved ice is not like the snow ice you find at other Ten Ren locations. Its literally shaved ice, not the soft melty heavenly goodness of snow ice. Its pretty much bingsoo in a taiwanese disguise. So dont be fooled like I was! Wahhh Service is pretty slow but when you do get acknowledged, the employees have been very friendly. They also give you free water when you sit down. The reason I give them three stars is for geographic reasons; besides Jumbo Jumbo and Bubble Tea Cafe, this is probably the best youll get for the DMV. Real tea in any milk tea always gets a plus from me as well. However, if this were located in the SGV, Id probably give it 2 stars. My standards are getting pretty low for this area. Sigh.

Still a fan. ??I was actually making my way to Simply Ovo Veggie, but I did not know that it was closed on Sunday.....   So swap vegetarian to Taiwanese food. ??This place is very packed on a Sunday afternoon. ??As usual there is not many serving staff, but whoever is on duty (the lone wolf) is always polite and present. ??I had a Pork Chop with Rice, an Appetizer Combo platter, my forever love - Fried Stringbeans, and of course a lovely cup of good quality green tea. ??The food is always on the mark, could be a bit slow coming out at times. ??It is worth the weight. ??Not to mention the it is student pricing.   You cannot come to this place without having the tea, the tea is of very good quality.

Stopped in real quick for a bubble tea... cause thats my new thing. And my friends make fun of me for it. But, hey! Its delicious!   And my mom likes it too! #BondingOverBoba is about to trend real hard!   Wonder how long this trend will last. ??In any event; my go to bubble tea is the House Black Milk Tea with Boba.   I love it. ??This place was interesting though. ??The boba were a little smaller than all the bubbles Ive gotten before. ??Im not sure if I LOVED that. ??But... it was definitely tasty tea and they were really quick to make it. ??  Everyone was very friendly. ??And they didnt skimp on the bubbles.   Id definitely go back. ??No diggidy  No Doubt

Nothing but good things about this place! Great little place with tons of flavor options. ??Their V-13 drink is amazing! Filled with tons of coconutty goodness, jelly, and red beans. If youre looking to try something new this drink is it!! ??Ive had their pork roll, which is very delicious, and also the beef stew. The beef practically melts in your mouth. ??So good I crave it all the time. ??I always look forward to coming back to Ten Rens!

I think I am in the middle here.  The tea selection is awesome. Had a melon milk tea and it was a little too sweet but still really yummy. Food was pretty average. Kung Pao chicken was nice and spicy but rice didnt seem at all fresh and had that hard layer from when it sits too long.   Saw a few people with the nuggets, if I go again Im going to try it.  My biggest complaint was the little 10oz paper cups they serve water in. The water tasted funny, too. I like to drink a good amount of water while having my meal and this was not an option here.

It was my husbands idea for us to try our dinner at this Ten Rens Tea Time restaurant in College Park, Maryland this past week. ??Im glad to have went along with this idea because the waitress serving our food was extremely nice and the teas were delicious. ??I admit that my husband forgot which tea he chose but I do remember the delightful tasting tea that he picked out for me (it was a green tea honey flavored tea that went with my food). We both found our food to be yummy, I had the shrimp fried rice while my husband had a beef bowl dish (which reminded him in a positive way of the beef bowl dish that he had when we were both stationed in Yokosuka Japan through the navy). We also shared delectable tasting fried pork dumplings.

Good place to meet people for tea or a quick snack. Lavender honey tea smells yummy. Shaved ice with mango and fried treats are good too. Convenient hours, good service.

I ordered beef noodle soup and Japanese green tea. They were both good! we ordered crinkle cut fries and Chicken nuggets for the table. They were really good, both seasoned with white pepper! I would order them again.

Full Disclosure: I was born in Taipei, Taiwan and moved to Los Angeles in grade school. That said, I know what Taiwanese and Chinese food is suppose to taste like and I have been to multiple Ten Rens in the Los Angeles area.  Food Order: Popcorn chicken rice (????????????). What I received is a dish that tasted suspiciously like McDonalds chicken nuggets smothered in a sweet&amp;sour/mayo sauce. At least when I was presented this dish, the server called this....chicken nugget rice (although the menu specifically said ????????????). At least the rice and pickled vegetables tasted like they are supposed to. Maybe they had to alter the menu to appeal to a different population?  Drink Order: Milk tea with boba. No complaints there. Standard Ten Ren quality tea with boba cooked to a correct consistency.  Will I come back? Not sure. But if i do, Ill be sure to order a different main course.

I love the bubble tea here!!  Its always fresh and delicious, without being overly sweetened. The Rockville location tends to bother me in that regard.   Ive never had the food but it looks pretty good.   The young woman at the cash wrap is very sweet, and helpful when it comes to choosing a good flavor. Shes also honest, which is something I can appreciate.   I couldnt even tell you the amount of times Ive been talked into ordering a horrible flavor. Its usually at the Rockville location, so I stick with honeydew and call it a day.  Ill take my chances here and try something new. The last visit ended with a raspberry chai...and its delicious.   So delicious that it may replace honeydew as my favorite. Maybe :P

The bubble tea here will kick the butt of every mall stand bubble tea youve ever had by far. The raspberry chai milk bubble tea without ice here is so good that I find myself specifically craving it. The food isnt the best but I like the red bean buns and the edamame and dumplings arent bad.   The staff has always been nothing but efficient and friendly. If you can manage to snag the booth actually just made from two couches and a table its an amazing place to sit with friends, play the board games provided on the bookshelf there, and drink some amazing tea. The tables are fine for that too, just not as much of a comfy back corner of the coffee house type of option.  The prices are definitely affordable and you can buy their loose tea to take home also for a reasonable cost. Generally a pretty chill atmosphere for a college town, definitely one of my favorites.

Nice little restaurant to stop by for a quick lunch. Came in with my boys earlier today and we enjoyed ourselves. Yaeji was very cool and friendly and overall the customer service was great. Definitely coming back.

Came here on a Monday evening. A really nice relaxing atmosphere. Tried the vanilla chai bubble tea to be safe but everything looked really good. Also got a spring roll which was only $1 and that was nice.   The three people I ate with all enjoyed their orders as well. Will definitely be returning!  Note-stayed a little later and it got busy and service got REALLY slow. I think they just need more employees... There were only one or two servers.   Also, I was watching the to go line and that moved pretty slowly as well.   Nice place to go if you arent in a rush.

The best part about this Ten Rens is that its pretty consistent and tasty. As long as the regular guy is working in the back, the bubble tea is never too sweet/syrupy and youll get a generous amount of bubbles/jelly.   Nice workers but sometimes when you sit for dine-in it takes a long long time to get someone to even take your drink order. I havent had much of the food, just a few appetizers which were yummy.   I love their bubble tea -- 4 stars because it is very expensive and flavors are kind of limited. (Add kumquat!)

Really yucky vegetarian food here. The tofu dishes are just a big pile of tofu with some white rice and nothing else, and the panfried dumplings have a very perfunctory filling.

Spent many evenings here slurping bubble tea and drooling over their shaved ice when in school. Very decently priced, the place is huge and they have games to keep you occupied - or people watching if you sit by the window!  The server messed up out order this time twice over and also messed up the check splitting - very annoying. But she was also super sweet and fixed both things, so I am not complaining too much!  Love the Mango shaved ice, and do get the Mango milk tea with boba and jelly.

The delicacy platter is amazing make sure you order it with a nugget sauce and sriracha

Absolutely love this place! =) Its a cute place to go to with a big / small group of friends or with your significant other. I try to order different meals every time I visit, but I cant resist the chicken nuggets and rice. Everything is just perfect, especially the sauce. You HAVE to try it if you havent yet. =P I am still working my way through the list of bubble teas and other beverages but as of right now, my favorite is the winter melon bubble tea with black tea. *mMm* My husband has tried the General Tsos and its been his go-to dish. If you arent sure which bubble tea goes with which tea, ask them. Their recommendations have yet to steer me wrong. =]

One star for the teas and bubble teas; theyre both really good! Zero for the food and most recently the service. The waiter switched my plate with another girlss plate after both of us had eaten parts of it due to a mix up on his part. We both just sat there for a minute in disbelief like really dude? You expect us to eat and pay for food another customer had already partially eaten? You didnt even try to apologize and remake the food? Anyway, the food tasted like microwaved flip-flops with the temperature gradient of a hot pocket simmered in a watery, overly sweetened sauce served with day old white rice. But actually yeah the food here is really bad. I do recommend the bubble teas though!

Max Kim is le best.   I enjoy having oolong tea as an option since most bubble tea places dont offer it. I also love the coconut milk tea + mango jelly! They typically dont have off days with the tapioca which is a plus and service is always quick and friendly. W00t!

Its a good Chinese restaurant with many delicious Taiwan desserts. We especially enjoy the Cha Xiang Beef Rice and octopus ball. Nevertheless, the octopus balls are not as good as what I had in China. BTW, the milk tea is also very good. You need to prepare some coins for parking.

Ive eaten here a million times, and its been pretty great each time.   The bubble tea is usually deliciously refreshing. However, today it was pretty disappointing. My friends and I ordered three different drinks. Each one was not balanced, and bland and watery-- it wasnt because of the ice either! Ive had all these drinks before and theyre usually great. So, the best thing to do is probably to try the drink once it comes out and if its not to your taste, ask them to remake it. Its too pricey not to.   The food was great as usual! I love the Tonkatsu with Rice and the Beef Stew with Noodle Soup.

This visit was so disappointing that not only did it change my opinion of the place but I definitely will not ever be returning.  My mother and I initially only ordered tapioca drinks to go, and so we decided to return here and actually dine in - order food.  We found a seat immediately for 3 and ordered shortly after. My mother ordered a shaved ice dessert with red bean and sweet milk. My girlfriend and I were hungry so we ordered vegetable dumplings, steamed pork buns and chicken nuggets to snack on with our honeydew and Japanese green milk tea smoothies with tapioca.   We got the chicken nuggets which are Taiwanese chicken poppers and vegetable dumplings reasonably quick. However, we were eating slow and almost done with STILL no drinks in hand. No water, nothing. We were dying of thirst. We asked the server where our drinks were as well as my mothers shaved ice dessert. We were told they were on the way. 40 minutes later - still nothing.  We flagged the server down and asked what the deal was. He let us know that the (literally) 20 people we just saw order drinks to go and walked out already were first priority. That when you order a drink to go, you are then put on top of the list. The individuals dining in, even if you just order drinks are then pushed down to the bottom of the list. WORST business practice ever. At this point, we finished the food and were still waiting on steamed pork buns, two tapioca drinks and a red bean shaved ice dessert. The server made it seem that WE were impatient. We had been there for over an hour and witnessed other tables sharing the same frustration.  After asking at least four times, we finally got out drinks and shaved ice dessert. The drinks were good, but came out wrong the first time. We had to send them back because they were not the right flavors. The second time around, they were the correct flavors but they forgot to substitute the regular milk for soy. At this point, we just took the drinks as is. The shaved ice dessert came out and we cancelled the steamed pork buns almost an hour and a half later.  So with that being said... service here is HORRIBLE.  Their attitudes were horrible and you could tell they could not care less about the business.  The food was decent. Definitely not worth what we went through. The only good thing about the food was that the dumplings were pan-fried the perfect amount. But the chicken nuggets were more breading than chicken. I have been to better spots in Rockville for Taiwanese style chicken.  The shaved ice dessert was OK.  The tapioca drinks are good when they make them right.   This was the final visit for us - dont bother wasting time or money here.

Its the only bubble tea place in College Park thats really been able to stick around, so thats saying something.   Their small bubble tea is smaller than what youll find at a lot of places in the area. Theirs is 12 oz, versus the 16 oz that I find to be the norm, so you might be a little confused when you first get it. The price is, naturally, fairly similar, around $3.50.   I stick with fruity green teas like passionfruit or guava, and sometimes ask them to make it a little less sweet. I also like their hot earl grey milk tea with bubbles. Avoid smoothies, which are painfully artificial tasting.   I rarely order their food, but Ive never had anything really bad.

This place is defs a 3, straight up mediocre. Good, but not great. Tasty, but not delicious. Staff attentive, but not that helpful.  We ordered the fried fishballs (since there was no more Takoyaki...so sad) and the tea eggs. I was pretty unsatisfied with the appetizers, for $5 I can get a whole bag of those fried fish balls at the asian store instead of 5 cold ones....As for the tea eggs, mine was tasty but my friends had been cooked for wayyy too long and was harshly bitter. I think I deserve a pat on the back from myself for being able to make these better at home....  It always seems weird to me to have general tsos on a legit asian menu, but the general tsos here was surprisingly delicious so I will accept it. I had the beef noodle soup, which was pretty damn yum. The beef was tender, the carrots were stewed well, and the broth tasty, but the noodles were overcooked and too squishy and there were random uncooked broccoli pieces in it (I have never experienced this in beef noodle soup...)  We had the Green Kings Tea and it was quite good. Definitely a good choice because it is the most expensive loose leaf tea to buy, but if you get a pot of tea while dining in all are the same price!

I agree with Elsa. ??You do not come here for the food. ??Ten Ren started off as a tea company and my goodness their tea is great. ??Especially when youve had a long day walking on campus. ??They use a different veggie bun now so no bueno but I tried their beef stew noodle and it is the best food item there!

A pretty good place if you are hungry for some snacks and conversations! If you are craving for some boba tea as well, try the honeydew milk tea its really great!

This place great for people who do not mind horrendous service. Food is ok but I will not be back as the service leaves alot to be desired. Fact is this was not even during busy time. 1) Cheese wonton is too sweet for an appetizer and the dumplings were bland, the edamame were not fresh slightly limpy. 2) The fried noodles needed some spicy chilly as it was also bland with a tiny bit of soy sauce. The Gens Taos tofu was good 3/5 but it lacked the kick of chillies. ??3) The bubble tea is nothing to shout about. ??Overall great place for students as they care about great price but are ok with tasteless food. Not really a 2 star but effort.

Good selection of bubble tea. I like getting the Tonkatsu or buns. My boyfriend loves getting their general tso.

If there was a zero star rating, I would have gave this place a zero star! The waitress not only forgot my friends order but also served a saltless chicken fried rice!

I set out with some friends for a visit to Ovo, but found them closed on Sunday, so we went here instead. A friend had recommended it and it is just one block away from Ovo, which I am crazy about.  We had some very mediocre food here, and a few mediocre bubble drinks that were sweet and pleasantly flavored but nothing at all to write home about. ??As far as the food goes, I will say that even the edamame were bland. Dumplings were okay, and the main courses were very uninspired.  I do recommend the seaweed salad, but that was the only thing that I liked.  Wait staff was very nice, the decor is bland but the atmosphere is kind of fun for hanging out with board games to play and such.  I was surprised to read that this restaurant is part of a large chain based in Taiwan, so it is the real deal. However, I did not love it.

I appreciate that they have alternative to milk with regards to their milk teas. However, the bubbles lately taste overcooked or overdone for having been made fresh daily - they tend to be chewy and dry (the Rockville location has more consistent quality bubbles that taste fresh, soft, moist, delicious). For food, tried the beef stew, which did not taste very good with regards to flavor.

Loved their mango mochi ice cream. Great selection of fragrant, flavorful teas and drinks. Very reasonable prices and good atmosphere.

Love the bubble tea here! My fianc?? and I drive around fifteen minutes just so we can get our bubble teas! I order the mango coolata blended bubble tea with tapioca. My fianc?? orders the honey dew bubble tea with tapioca.

Maybe I came at a bad time? I was sitting there and the dishes started coming out... then after all my friends finished eating and we were in a rush. After they finished, I sat there waiting for mine, the bad thing was the waiter told me my dish would be coming right up before hand, after waiting about 20-30 minutes I gave up and told them to cancel my order... Just to find out my order was been made, they accidentally had it to go, they gave me it for free. The fact they made me wait and watch my friends eat was terrible.  BUT! They have good food.

Love this place! The atmosphere is great for a date or just to go out with friends. I recommend their tea smoothies (GREEN TEA MILK SMOOTHIE IS THE BOMB!). Some time the wait for just a drink can be WAY to long, but I keep going back because the tea is so delicious!

YUM! Delicious food that comes out piping hot. Theres nothing I wouldnt recommend. The bubble tea is the bees knees. Its the real thing and delicious.   Its a great place to meet up with people, especially if there are things to be done and talked about. Theres plenty of space for eating and typing up notes. Youre easily able to plug a computer in and stay for a while. No one rushes you out.  This is one of the places I sincerely miss since moving away from CP.

Came here with a bunch of my MAUVSA friends, to see what the hype is about. The milk tea is fairly good, there was no powder or syrup-y residue in the drink, and the bubbles were the perfect amount of chewy.  Their chicken nuggets are really good as well. Its addicting!! (*___*)  I like the atmosphere of the place as well, slightly tucked in, but a place for intimate interactions.

The whole problem with asking the staff here to give you a recommendation on bubble tea is that theyll tell you go with the red bean instead of the Thai tea and from then on, youll love the red bean so much that out of the three times youve been here, thats the only thing youve gotten.  One day Ill get around to enjoying something else from the menu, but red bean is my jam.

Review for the tea only. Laaaaarge selection of tea, including multiple types of green. Im unsure of the use of powder/syrup situation (I get unsweetened usually).   Tastes wonderful. A little on the expensive side for certain types of tea (which is expected).

As a Virginian, I generally despise Maryland. Maybe its because thats how I was indoctrinated, living on the other side of the Potomac. That said, my employer sent me to College Park for a week, and thanks to Yelp, I escaped my windowless office in the basement of a government building and discovered this place, so now I cant hate on Maryland any more. Well, I cant hate on College Park, at least. Baltimore still sucks. Anyways, the iced oolong tea with lychee bubbles was amazing, and the beef bowl is delicious. Plus, the atmosphere here is so bright and cheery, especially up front by the windows overlooking Baltimore Avenue. Perfect place to chill with friends, play some Battleship or Jenga (yes they have board games!), and people watch...cause Terrapin women are just damn, which makes me feel dirty as a Wahoo and a Patriot, but you have to give props when props are due. This is easily a place I would have expected in a city like Austin or Portland, yet its right here in the DC area.

Nice service and delicious bubble tea which they are happy to make with soy milk instead of half-and-half, which I definitely appreciate. I have tried a chicken dish and an eel dish and in both cases, the food was good and tasted fresh, but the sauce was way too heavy. For college park, really a great find.

Service: Food comes out quickly and servers are friendly. Eaten and/or ordered here over a hundred times and havent had one bad experience.   Food: Ive only really ever ordered four items here and they all taste good. I highly recommend the Max Kim...delicious.  Environment: Nice and quiet place to study in the mornings and afternoons, and fun lively place to bring your friends in the evenings.

First bubble tea experience was a success!  Cant speak to the food, but the vanilla chai bubble tea was delicious, though it seemed to take forever to get.   Theres not a whole lot to this place...tile floor, a few tvs, tables. Not a very cozy place, as you will, which is what I look for in a tea place. Oh well.

always get a large honey dew smoothie with tapioca pearls after a hair cut. found this place has one of the best tapioca pearls that you can chew dunno if that sounds weird to you but yea lol the texture of it is alot better than the other ones ive tried but for a large is 6$ . the dine in area is nice and subtle where many people come to study and socialize from what ive seen.

My go to location for bubble tea in College Park! Tea is authentic and freshly brewed and their tapioca balls are always perfect! Not too soft, not too hard!   Food is decent as well! I definitely recommend their chicken nuggets, beef noodle stew and beef bowl with rice.

If you visit this place in person, youll see that it gets a lot more love than Yelp seems to suggest. Basically, Im arguing that the reviews which give this an overall 3.5 stars isnt representative of the popularity of this place. And Id know because I walk past this place tens of times a week, and have been there ~50 times myself.  I like the food here - a nice variety of things. The green tea noodles are a personal favorite, as is the superb udon soup. The portions are sizeable and the prices are really reasonable as well. If you order the buns, ask for the chilli oil to dip them in.   The staff is always fantastic - friendly and attentive. It can take a bit of time getting the order when the place is jam packed, but nothing completely extraordinary.

One of my absolute favorite tea spots. Definitely try the Raspberry Chai - it is just delicious and the cinnamon is super yum. Also love the spring rolls and the kung pao chicken.

Ive been here multiple times, and generally my experiences have been very mixed.   For the most part, the bubble tea is good. There are many different flavors and I enjoy getting the hot option in the colder months.  The food is decent and they recently added a Taiwanese Authentic Dishes page on the back which was a nice addition. I ordered a Shrimp Pancake and it was fairly good.   However, the service here is a hit or miss. In the past, I came here for dinner. It took me and my friend 2 hours to get out of there. First, it took us about 10 minutes to even be noticed by a server. After that, I guess they supposed we needed 15 minutes to pore over the menu. Then after we ate, we looked around for the servers to give us our check. Well we did this for about 10 minutes, then asked the server for the check, which proceeded to take another 20 minutes to come. At that point we should have just brought the check to the register but we didnt. Waited another 10 minutes for them to take the check and another 10 to return it. I wish I could say that they were busy, but there were only about 5 other tables full. After that experience, I did not come for a very long time.   My most recent experience, however, was great. The server was fast and attentive, and for once I did not even have to ask for the check.  Im going to give this place 3 stars instead of 2 because of my last experience, and I hope that they will keep it up!

The noodles there are quite special because they consist of tea. But some main food there is not as yummy as I thought. I would highly recommend the beef noodles and Boba tea.

We came to this place after visiting the White House, which is about 30 mins from DC. The food is tasty, but less choices than expected. The bubble tea is the bomb. We also tried the fried tofu, it really hit the spot with the spicy sauce. The only thing with this place is they only have 1 waitress to run the whole floor.... Please be expected longer waiting time... I guess they know about it thus therere some magazines and board games for customers to kill time.

While in the area with an ungodly hankering for bubble tea, we couldnt avoid stopping here for some tapioca goodness. To me, the Ten Ren brand has always been synonymous with fantastic quality tea. Ive gotten bubble tea at their tiny shoe box Mott street location in NYC more times than I can count. This location is way bigger with a much larger food selection. I remember Ten Rens used to offer warm bubble tea but alas, this location does not. Service was polite but a little confused. I opted for the following yums:  Thai Milk Tea! - ??Just like the thai tea youd get in restaurants but stronger and with tapioca. Awesome bright orangey color. Who could resist this?!  Vanilla Black Milk Tea! - Tasted like freakin cookies. Chewy fresh tapioca too.. MMMmmmm Delicious! Stupid me should have gotten a large.  Taro Bun! - ??Great squishy bun consistency but really disappointing in the taste dept. I had a carving for Taro that day, too bad.  Vegetable bun! - Squishy bun, decent filling. Carrots, onions and mushrooms filled this large fluffy bun to my hearts content.  Metered parking till 10PM(!) with the meter maid on partol like a boss. Better have your quarters with ya.

This was the worst service I have ever received... Our waitress messed up my order (a smoothie is not the same as regular bubble tea) and took forever getting our food out. She failed to inform us at the beginning when we placed our orders that she wouldnt be giving us split checks. She didnt even try to help the situation and simply stood there.

Yum. I got honeydew and my booboo got Thai milk bubble tea. ??Its really good. Just a bit more pricier for bubble smoothie but still a good drink. Very refreshing. Would come again

I had Max, whos really good looking, as my server and had a great experience.  I had the honey green milk tea and the seafood udon.  Ill definitely be back!

I think they changed their layout or how to order. Now the order table is to the left after ordering.   My friends got the Thai iced tea which was good and not too sweet. I got the taro milk tea which also wasnt drowning in sugar, only bad part was that it tasted like dust.  I thought they were generous on the amount of bobas per cup.

After dinner down the street, I needed to indulge in my sweet tooth. I can get very cranky if I dont have dessert. That urge must be pacified.   I dragged my mom in here and on a Sunday night, it was very packed. Many of the tables were not cleared off (they need a busboy/busgirl STAT) and basically they were short on staff.   We ended up seating ourselves and ordered some dessert at the counter. My mom got a shaved ice with red bean and milk. This is a Taiwanese dessert staple and she really enjoyed it. Reminded her of the street food in Taipei.   I didnt have an easy time ordering. What the hell? This place does not carry soy milk. This place is a disgrace to my Chinese ancestry. I mean, goodness, wine is to Italians as soy milk is to the Chinese. Like really? FML.   In any case, after pouring over the menu, I decided on a passionfruit slushie. It also came with tapioca pearls, which were weird with the slushie. The pasisonfruit was just way too sweet for me and I only drank less than half of my order.   This place is great to hang out and get a snack to eat. Lots of bubble tea options, smoothies, slushies, shaved ice desserts. They also popular Taiwanese snack foods, but I have never eaten here, so I have no comment.   Not sure I would be back, but when you are in College Park, Maryland, your choices are limited and sometimes you must settle. Sigh...

This place is very ok in terms of bubble tea and food. The bubble tea itself is pretty good I always get the mango oolong with boba, but its kind of expensive compared to how much you get and they also put a large amount of ice. Food quality is very ok, wont go out of my way or crave anything there food wise, but if Im there I might grab something to eat. All in all just a very ok place.

Theres free Wi-Fi, the food is good, and the bubble tea is great. I recommend the Chicken Cutlet Noodle Soup or the Beef Noodle Soup. Both are my favorites, and everyone that Ive recommended it to has loved it as well. As for bubble teas, I recommend the milk teas over the smoothies. The smoothies arent made with real fruit, so sometimes its too sweet or tastes powdery. The warm milk teas are excellent though. Tastes very authentic, and the bubbles are always perfect.

The bubble tea was good. I had the honeydew smoothie. Very sweet and flavorful, and the boba was good quality. They dont have an extensive menu for smoothies but enough to please most palates. Its not the best bubble tea ever, but it will definitely satisfy any cravings.  I think where Ten Ren won me over was their takoyaki dish, which I can only describe as little octopus pancake balls. Better than it sounds, trust me. Crispy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. Seasoning and sauce was perfect, and the octopus chunk was tender. It seemed to be missing beni shoga (pickled ginger), green onion, katsuoboshi (bonito flakes), and some other fillings/toppings that Im used to seeing, but that didnt take much away from the dish.   Most people come for the bubble tea and the wifi. Maybe the other food sucks, but I wouldnt know. If you try one food item here, let it be the takoyaki.

A friend brought me and a couple more of our friends here because none of us had ever been here and our one friend promised it was great. Although the tea selections had more variety than anyone could actually need, the food was a huge disappointment. Most of us had meals that werent very good and I ordered some kind of bread pocket with ground beef inside of it. As soon as I bit into it I felt that the beef on the inside was still completely frozen. I asked to have it taken off the bill rather than re-heat it as I had already seen enough and chose to take my business else where.

I was originally super excited that there was a Ten Rens somewhat in the Baltimore area.  However, this Ten Rens food downright sucks (no to the spicy beef noodle soup and another no to the chicken nuggets). The food is a terrible representation of classic Taiwanese fast food eats. So heed my warning, dont eat the food at this Ten Rens.  The only thing good here is the boba, its made the right way, with the right amount of chewiness. Service (by one lone waitress on a somewhat busy Saturday lunch) was efficient and friendly.

Having come back to Ten Rens many many times since my last review, this is definitely a 5-star place in my book.  The bubble tea is still a great treat. I, being a pretty boring person, always stick with green or black milk tea. Hot on cold days and cold on hot days. (Very predictable? Yes. Please dont try to kill me; death by bubble tea is nice but not how I pictured going.) I havent heard any complaints about any of the flavors from my more adventurous friends who order other flavors. Everyone is always very satisfied with the bubble tea.  Since writing my last review, I have eaten here at Ten Rens quite a few times. The food can be good! You just have to know what to order. Never underestimate the power of asking your server what is good, whether its for your beverage or your meal.  Aubrey, my regular and favorite server, recommended for me the seafood udon once and I loved it. Its a bit spicy, but I like the kick that I get from that soup. (And I usually shy away from spicy foods.) Its hearty and the portion is large enough that I usually have to put a bit of effort into finishing. I also have a guilty pleasure - them chicken nuggets. I dont know why I order them so much but I almost always do, either as the appetizer or as a meal slathered in (what they always call) Chick-Fil-A sauce. OM. FREAKING. NOM. NOM. I usually feel guilty and full of regret after eating them, but I order them almost every time I am here.  I can always count on Ten Rens for a great bubble tea and some yummy snacks. Also, its a nice place to study (free wi-fi!), play board games, read Chinese comics and magazines, or buy tea.

Woke up one day and was craving boba tea, I googled Ten Ren (since its my favorite place in NYC) and came upon the closest place in DC. This place was AWESOME! It was spacious and quiet. The service was superb and she knew exactly what I wanted (PEACH GREEN TEA LARGE - no sugar- ??WITH BOBA!!!) The Taiwanese chicken/tea eggs/buns were so good. The only downside is paying for parking but thats okay, Ill be coming back soon ... like really really soon. ENJOY!

Ive been coming here for years, and Ive been pretty disappointed lately. There have been a lot of positive changes, but unfortunately, the negative changes are the ones that really stick with ??me.   First, they decreased the size of their regular bubble tea, but increased the price. Their bubble tea is the best in the immediate area, but is only okay if youre willing to drive 20 minutes out. If Ten Rens wasnt so convenient, I probably wouldnt come here that often.  Second, service has gotten very inconsistent. Some of the servers are great (and also my friends so maybe Im biased), but there have been new servers over the past year that are just so unfriendly and inattentive.   Lastly, they charge like 70 cents more for hot bubble tea. This isnt a change in policy, but its one that Ive never understood. I have never been to a bubble tea place that has charged more for hot bubble tea, and Ive been to a lot. Not to mention, the cups for hot bubble tea are actually cheaper than the regular plastic cups, but I guess they dont think thats enough to absorb the (unnecessary) additional cost.  On the bright side, they do have new menus, and the decor is more attractive now. There are some new items on the menu too, which I hear good things about. I dont normally eat here because I think most of the food is mediocre, but the beef stew, chicken nuggets, and dumplings are still tasty.  Overall, this place is very okay. Nothing stellar, but worth it if its what youre in the mood for.

Ten Ren has come a loooonnnggg way since my reviews last year. And in the last year, Ive eaten my way through a good portion of its menu. Heres an updated list on the places pros:  -- Still the best bubble tea in CP (and arguably, that Ive tried in the DMV)... with the exception of avocado flavor.  -- Authentic Chinese food. The ground pork with rice and beef stew noodles are my personal favorites, but you can never go wrong with the red bean buns, cheese wontons, or chicken nuggets as appetizers.   -- TONS of seating and free Wi-Fi, making it the perfect location to study with friends or just hang out.   -- Awesome wait staff. This is the biggest improvement Ten Ren has made... theyve definitely tightened management and gotten rid of some of their less than stellar employees. Service is QUICK and attentive!  Nothing but good things to say this time around. Glad to have found my go-to on Route 1 for quality bubble tea and Asian treats.

this place is great - real nice vibe inside, friendly staff, comfortable couches. The bubble tea is almost all great but I WISH THEY WOULD CHILL WITH THE SAUCE ON THEIR GENERAL TSOs!! I got the general Tsos expecting the same quality as their other dishes but it tasted like a greasy mall food court bastardization of a staple dish. Otherwise no complaints good spot

Its been a couple weeks since I went to Ten Rens Tea Time for the first time. ??I got some friend dumplings and some sort of soup. ??Chicken? Beef? ??I cant remember now, but does it matter. Yes - the meal was THAT memorable ;P Everything I tasted was bland and, save for the great company and conversation I had with a friend of mine while eating, the entire experience was quite forgettable. ??I do remembering adding a bunch of sauce to give the dumplings some kick (not that it helped much). The Edamame was solid, but nothing special.  Honestly, it was really disappointing for me. I love East Asian food - Chinese, Japanese, Korean - I take the opportunity to try many different restaurants. ??That being said, there are a ton of places out there now to choose from and I really feel that some are just skating by on their past laurels or not even trying at all anymore. ??Ten Rens falls somewhere in the middle for me. ??I am rounding this review up to a three because the food wasnt completely horrible, it was just uninspired. ??I am telling you now though: it really is more like a 2.5... tops. Doubt I will be back.

Gotta love the bubble tea here !!!! iYoggie and Ten Ren are the best and I think ONLY places in College Park for Bubble Tea. Ten Ren has a lot of different flavors and the staff is very friendly too.   I also had dinner at this place once and being a vegetarian I must say that they did have many choices but the food was okay-ish. Not too good. I went there with a friend and we ordered a lot of vegetarian dishes but most of them were bland and we didnt like the taste except the szechuan tofu which was flavorful.  4 stars only for its Bubble Tea !!!

Ended up at Ten Rens today for the first time since, I think, I was a student at UMCP. Brought back fond memories of hangovers, panicked cramming, and a messy breakup on the couch in the corner. Good times!  Everything appeared the same except the menus were updated (yay for all the pictures! who needs literacy??) and now you need a password to use the free wifi (teatime888).  Food-wise, I stuck to my old stand-bys. I remembered the edamame as my favorite edamame I HAD EVER HAD, largely because of the spices they used for seasoning; alas, that perfect concoction was gone, replaced with boring old salt and pepper. *tear* Luckily, the pan-fried pork dumplings were still greasy, delicious goodness! (<a href=http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xAtk2QCUr_C9f40zszQxyg?userid=Oe4LLtN1tn46sDUM-BSX_A>yelp.com/biz_photos/xAtk??</a>)  I rolled the dice with the shredded pork rice noodle soup (<a href=http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xAtk2QCUr_C9f40zszQxyg?select=oOwuPXGgcewADcdCWqDMYw>yelp.com/biz_photos/xAtk??</a>), which was...a whole lot better after I brought it home and doctored it up with some ginger and hot sauce.  Ten Rens is a quiet, relaxing spot thats a nice break from the rest of Route 1. Good for studying alone, chatting with a friend, or doing whatever else college students do when their meal doesnt include copious amounts of alcohol.

I thought the food and service was decent and I would be back for Takoyaki. ??They may need to hire additional wait staff during peak hours to ensure faster service, but other than that is a fun place to have a meal.

Since it was my first time, I strolled up to the counter to ask the girl working what she thought - and I need to first off comment that she was AWESOME. Gave me GREAT recommendations, was incredibly happy and cheerful and helpful, and offered to remake my order if it wasnt to my liking. She told me that not only was there soymilk available, but also that most of the drinks were made with nondairy creamer, and we bonded over being lactose intolerant.  What I ended up ordering was a blended special: some kind of yogurt/taro/something else mix, black tea, bubbles. It was absolutely incredible, delicious, and addictive. I paid $5 for the large size, but at the rate Im going to start consuming Ten Ren, Im going to have to just order the small if I want to afford rent!  Atmosphere was very nice, calm, not very busy during the mid-afternoon. It has a good vibe, even if it is a little bit overpolished. The big thing that would make it better is if their wifi was working...  Ill definitely be back to try their other teas, and the food at some point in time.

As you can guess, the bubble tea is the star of the show. Good ole Taro is my favorite but there are four pages of flavors to choose from. The food, unfortunately, isnt as good. The Fried Rice with Chinese sausage is decent but a little bland. Ask for some hot sauce or chilies to spice it up. The Sweet and Sour Chicken my friend ordered was nicely cooked but also bland. The filling in the pork Pan Fried Dumplings is delicious but the dough can be gummy, as if the cook forgot to flip them in the pan.  The staff is very young but they are really friendly and knowledable about the menu. Even if the food isnt memorable, Ten Rens is a great place to hang out with friends or do some studying. They have free wi-fi and a stack of board games in the corner, which makes it a fun alternative to hanging out Starbucks.

I dont if its me or their drinks just gets worse every single time I come in...it use to be good...idk what happened. Its too powdery

Ten Ren has a great variety of teas, hot or cold, made with water or non dairy products. Servers are super friendly and cool college environment. ??So go hang out and watch a ball game on their flat screens or carry out a delicious Chai Tea, Oolong, or black teas with your favorite fruit flavors!

I ordered the Pur-Erh Beef Stew w. Rice and ??Green Bubble tea. The rice cuisine is so so but the tea is good. Only recommend come to here to drink something.

This is, hands down, the cutest place in College Park. The ambiance is very bright and relaxed and the employees are friendly and helpful.   The tea selection is impressive. They have a large range of black, oolong, green, and herbal teas. I usually get a pot of loose-leaf tea but the bubble tea is quite good as well.  The only reason Im giving four stars rather than five is because the food could be better. The takoyaki and dumplings are good, but more substantial meals have been (at least in my experience) on the decent side of mediocre.

Ill admit I was shocked when I saw a Ten Rens in Maryland of all places. Having just moved to the area 2 days prior, this caused for legitimate excitement. But as soon as you crack open the menu it becomes apparent. This place isnt the real deal Ten Rens. This franchise dominates Taiwan and Asian bastions in Southern California. Since I have been to Ten Rens in both I can tell you for damn sure the one at College Park isnt remotely similar to the real deal.  If youre not familiar with any Taiwanese or Asian fare in general, the obvious give away is having General Tsos or Kung Pao Chicken on the menu (this even tries to sell Maruchan ramen for 5 dollars). The menu at this place only carries foods the average American would assume to be Asian. Now I know Im not going to get authentic Taiwanese or Asian food over here in Maryland, but Im not crazy at the fact they slapped a Ten Rens sign outside of this establishment.  We tried the beef and pork stew which were pretty tender albeit dull in flavor. The dumpling appetizers were obviously store bought so they were heavy in dough and light on meat. I got a regular black milk tea with boba and over here regular equates to only about 10-12 oz. for 4 bucks plus tax, definitely a ripoff. The boba had no flavor but the tea was decent. The staff composed of I think 4 guys and one girl. It seemed like the girl was doing the majority of the work herself. She took out orders, gave us food, cleaned every table, and tended to the entire restaurant alone. She was nice eye candy to have around but she obviously needed some help. Ill probably check out the Rockville location at some point, but the College Park location is a bust. This is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Dont let the name deceive you.

Ah, the city of College Park, Maryland. Its a place where class and trash marinate together in a dumpster filled with empty Natty Light cans and Ratsis regurgitated pizza. Only here will you see 18-year-olds driving Land Rovers with New York license plates down Frat Row, while two blocks away someone is getting jumped for their NorthFace jacket in broad daylight. (I kid, I kid, I hear its gotten safer since I graduated...)  CP will forever have a place in my heart, and during my four years of residency I came to know and love a handful of food spots. College Park is funny--although there are thousands of students living there spending money on the daily, most ??restaurants last less than a semester and the turnover is mindboggling. One staple that has lasted the test of time is Ten Rens. Even though Ten Rens is in the downtown Route 1 area (near Cornerstone,  The Barking Dog previously Thirsty Turtle, Curious Tattoo, Bagel Place, etc.) when I refer to it in conversation, no one has a clue what Im talking about.   Allow me to enlighten you. Want some crazy-delicious bubble/boba tea in any flavor imaginable? Check (I get coffee bubble tea...holy crap its GOOD.) ??Want some crispy amazing General Tsos chicken, SANS a side of food poisoning (thanks a lot, Shanghai)? Check. Schezwan Chicken with delicious cabbage on the side? Check. Creamy, amazing crab Rangoon? CHECK-A-ROO. You just cant go wrong at Ten Ren.  The inside of Ten Ren is surprisingly nice. Its always clean and is kept modern. They have huge tables and even sofas so you can post up and study with some snacks. My only complaint is that the service, while friendly, is...weird. Sometimes you walk in and sit down, and it takes 10 minutes for someone to take your order. Other times, theyre there in a flash. When you want the bill, sometimes theyll come take your cash, other times you just walk up to the register. Its always ambiguous and confusing, different each time. I suppose depending on the staff and time of day it changes but happens without warning. Otherwise, I find Ten Rens to be the most solid choice for Chinese food, bubble tea, and a meal with a friend in College Park!

I really love the Thai milk bubble tea here its pretty amazing!! The shrimp fried rice is also good and they give you a really good portion of it that sometimes I cant even finish (yayy leftovers!!). Its a really good place to go with your friends and on dates! The service is good too!

At times wonderful and deliciously Asian. ??Chicken dishes are both of the above. ?? Pork lacks taste. ?? Great tea.

Yummy local Chinese food and bubble tea. ??They have a wide range of bubble teas, and weve been having fun trying a different kind each time we go. ??All the Chinese dishes weve gotten have been very tasty. ??The chicken served has very little fat on it, and whatever kind of batter they use leaves a nice delicate crunch. ??The one negative is the slow service so dont go here if you are in a hurry. ??Music is low so it is easy to have a conversation with your table mates.

The bubble tea here as well as the desserts are DELICIOUS. But they should really stop trying to make food, not sure their food even counts as food? Their ramen for one is awful and Im sure that you could make it yourself and it would taste so much better. But I guess you get what you pay for.

Normally, I dont eat/drink at Ten Ren because on the west coast, its on the bottom of my scale and I usually go to better places to have boba. While in Maryland, I was surprised to actually see a Ten Ren so being curious, we walked in, looked through the menu, and decided to have dinner here.   Its actually quite popular among students (who walk in just for the tea), while many locals actually sit down and order an entree. In order to sit inside, you need to order something other than tea (like a rice plate or noodles). I tried the kung pao chicken, but found it disappointing and a bit too salty. However, the boba was alright (skip the pearls), but next time, I want to try the teas that they offer.   The waitress was really nice to my table and spoke fluent mandarin.

If I want bubble tea with real tea in it, then I come here, usually for regular milk tea, peach black tea, or mango black tea. Most of the other bubble teas are decent, but sometimes you have to know what you want, like asking for less sugar or no ice. The price may be higher than Yami Yamis, at least it was such a few years ago, but I havent done the calculations since Yami Yami raised their prices.  Their ginger honey tea is really good in the winter days - it clears out your sinuses and warms you up inside out. I really recommend their hot teas (in pots) for winter, because nowhere else on that strip of Route 1 has true Chinese black, green, and herbal teas.   As for food, it depends. I like their Szechuan chicken with rice, spring rolls, and toast. Shredded pork with rice is pretty good too. Ive had their beef noodle soup before, and its not near what real Taiwanese beef noodle soup tastes like (I lived in Taiwan for 11 years). One of my friends really loves their cheese wontons, though I just dont like cheese in general.   Ambiance: I like how Ten Rens is spacious and the couches are pretty comfortable. The noise level usually isnt too loud, at least during the day and early evening. Sometimes if theres a huge group the noise level can get ridiculous, but thats expected.   Service: this is truly inconsistent. Sometimes the waitresses are nice and will let you sit down even if you ordered at the counter, usually when the shop is almost empty. Other times they chase you out even if the shop is empty. (Disclaimer: Ive known several people whove worked at Ten Rens during my college years.) I suppose it helps to know the servers, because Ive seen their friends get better service than complete strangers, though honestly most of the time it depends on personality of the server. One weird thing Ive noticed is that quite a few of my guy friends despise the service there because the waitresses have been rude to them, but my girl friends have no trouble with the service and love to go.   At one point Ten Ren had free wifi, last time I went in May 2011 or so, they didnt.

I know how much many people love this place, but I find the restaurant - spotty.   Its probably because Ive never eaten or had tea there; Ive always gone the take out route. ??And for us take-outers, its been a weird ride. ??  Ten Ren used to have a spot for games and such, that doubled as a space for the takeout crew to sit the time away, but no more. ??They turned it into a counter space, which now is for order in  customers only. ??Take out is limited to the ordering machine and no more.  The main reason I dont order in, is not because I hate tipping, but the menu is boring, except for the steamed buns, specifically the pork and veggie, which I dont even eat. ??They are usually ordered for my husband or my in-laws. ??Well, all this is true, unless the buns machine is broken that it was for something like six months or more.

Ive never tried their food, but I absolutely LOVE their bubble tea! I love how its made right in front of you and that the people making the drinks actually know what they are doing. I can honestly say I go every week just for their bubble tea.

When my wife used to go to UMCP, we would go here constantly for dinner. ??Food was delicious, prices were great, and service was generally fast. ??They have great bubble tea options and were one of the first in the area to offer them.  I feel so boring for getting it, but General Taos Chicken was done so wonderfully here. ??They brought to life a very standard dish. ??The misses would get Green Tea Noodles. And of course youd have to get a dish of steamed dumplings.  If Route 1 traffic wasnt so horrible, and I didnt live in Germantown, Id still be going here on a regular basis. ??SO GOOD.

If I checked in here as much as I go, Id be labelled as an addict - not that Im ashamed.   I like this place. I used to go here in college to meet up with a group of classmates and vent and play games. Now, I go to get some bubble tea and a quick bite to eat. I love the peach black bubble tea. It is the sweetness that I like my drinks to have. They are the only Ten Ren that Ive been to that offers food. (Ive been to the Bethesda location and the NY location). Their food isnt fatty and tastes authentic.   If you arent a fan of bubbletea, you can drink it on a nice walk and have a bubble spitting contest with friends, or you can just get the drinks without it. I wouldnt. I wont. I dont. But Im just trying to give you some options.

Im going to be nice and give Ten Rens four stars in spite of my mixed experience. I came in here because I read on Yelp that they have excellent steamed veggie buns and good bubble tea. Well, when I came in they said they had no buns because the steamer was broken. Boo.   I got peach bubble tea, and it was pretty good, but-- call me naive-- I was surprised by the fact that it was an actual watery beverage in a cup and not a Slurpee-textured drink. I have gotten bubble tea many times at pho restaurants, at a kiosk in Annapolis Mall, and every time I go to Korean-run Spa World, which is fairly often-- and each time it has automatically been of a slushy consistency. Therefore, I didnt even realize it could come as just a plain liquid. To get that kind of consistency, you have to order a Smoothie. I saw those on the menu but figured smoothie meant fruit mixed in, rather than the Spa World style of mixing ice and tea powder. Im not docking them a star for my own gaijin (?) mistake, but I wanted to mention it here to those of you who may be like me-- adventurous enough to think you know what youre doing, yet not as aware as you thought.  I plan to go back and get the steamed buns sometime. Its a nice little place.

If youre looking for tea, Ten Rens is the place to be!  The hot tea selection is great. ??Personally, Im a big fan on the green tea with jasmine. ??They also sell many varieties of tea leaves if you want to make it at home.  Ten Rens bubble tea is pretty good- not my first choice place to get it in the area, but still good. ??The smoothies with milk taste overly medicine-y to me. ??The watermelon one they used to have tasted like straight pepto-bismol. ??Try the taro if you want to see what Im talking about.  The shaved ice is definitely something to try. ??Red bean is my favorite!  From the foods I have tried here, they are pretty good. ??I hear the soup with beef is delicious!  Ten Rens no longer gives you a free bubble tea on your birthday. :( ??Weak.  If you order food here, you can do work and enjoy their free wifi. ??But only if you order something!

The service was horrible. That tall manager guy was so rude to us. And the servers didnt even pay attention to their customers. We had to flag them down so much that it almost got to the point where we got up and left. The food was edible. Bubble tea was passable. All in all food and boba was good. The people there not so much. And that one guy whos always sitting behind the counter talking to all the waitresses creeps me out. Always staring at their butts every time they walk by. Dudes a creep.

I love bubble tea but you cant trust everyones tapioca pearls if you know what I mean...   I was told about this place while in the neighborhood so we walked there to give it a try, it was everything I needed at the time. The flavor was perfect, I got the green tea milk smoothie which is what I always get. So we went again a few weeks later, not the same person making it, it was horribly flavorless. They added too much ice and watered it down, I called back and asked if it could be made again and it was, no problem. Then again a few weeks later got that crazy craving and had someone else go and grab one, they threw it out because guess what, it was horrible. The same thing happened with the adding of too much ice again and watered it down making it taste so bland. I must say, Im kinda over it so dont know how I feel about going back, and the food looks so damn good, I just dont know...

Ive never tried bubble tea before, so coming to this place was ind of exciting, it did not disappoint. There were a ton of options between hot and iced teas, ad smoothies. I wanted to try the bubbles so I asked for them on the side. I loved them, they have a texture kind of like a chewy gummy bear. ??  It was pretty quiet, which was great since a friend and I came in to finalize details for ??a trip. Overall the place was clean and friendly, and the smoothie and spring roll I had were delicious. The only negative thing I can say is that our waitress was a bit inattentive, but I cant complain too much. Ill definitely be back!

I remembered when this place first opened. I thought it was a nice alternative from Starbucks. I dont recall them serving food then as all I bought from them was just bubble tea. I think the tea was good. Not too sweet. The tapioca balls have nice and chewy texture.

The Bubble Tea is fine and all but the star is coming from them being rude to me on numerous occasions. For example Ive came in with my girlfriend and paid for her bubble tea, and then we decided to sit in and let her enjoy it. I was asked to leave because I didnt purchase anything, even after I paid at check out in this tiny little place.  And its pricey.

3 stars for the food and prices and 4 stars for the tea! I really like this places assortment of types of bubble teas all of them amazing. Shooing out $5 for a large drink however is not too appealing. The taste of the fruity and the milk teas are great most of the time (Ive had mango, Thai, caramel and coconut) that price is what is most upsetting as a poor college student. Some of the teas werent so great some days like they lacked flavor but I guess different people make it different ways. The atmosphere is nice and the staff was okay.

I like the smoothie bubble tea but I would say the dishes are mediocre. I feel like the bubble tea is very hyped, its not AMAZING but its pretty good and something Id recommend to a friend. The dishes are not bad, its okay, but not a something to crave for. For example the donkkatsu is not bad but it lacked meat n flavor. I would give the food a rating of 6.5/10 Bubble tea 8.9/10  The strawberry shaved ice is really good

Let me just start off by saying the ONLY thing thats probably worth getting here is the bubble tea. I got the green matcha tea with tapioca because I thought a green tea bubble tea was quite unique (or at least no other tea place ive been to I think has this flavor). Anyway the green tea tasted like some good green tea icecream in liquid form, not too sweet and not artificial. AND the tapioca bubbles were perfectly chewy! If I was only reviewing the bubble tea, I would probably give this place 5 stars. But since I came here for lunch...  So we ordered some rice dishes (beef, sweet and sour chicken, stir-fry chicken) and 1 noodle dish. The dishes were so SAUCY and Americanized. By no means did it taste absolutely bad or anything but definitely not my cup of tea :( I wouldnt go here for lunch again, the food was just so amateur. However, the noodle dish did look pretty decent (I didnt order it so Im not sure how it actually tastes), so if youre here for lunch, try the noodles I guess, otherwise skip out and just get a bubble tea..or two!

The best thing about this place is the tea. Other than that, the service is terrible. If they were constantly busy with customers, the lack of attention and unwelcoming environment would make sense, but that is not the case at all. From the moment we stepped inside, most of the tables were dirty with napkins, crumbs, and straws from the previous customers. We wiped one of the tables off and waited for five minutes for someone to greet us. There were literally four other people there and the waiter was just standing there doing nothing, therefore, the delay was inexcusable.   When it was time to order, I specifically asked for the green tea noodles and was given udon noodles. This was brought to the waiters attention and he was willing to correct the mistake, but I hate to see food go to waste so I kept the noodles. Eventually, I ate everything else besides the noodles because it was way to soft and soggy. When we were done eating, we waited half an hour for our check. When we realized that the waiter was avoiding us, we got up and went to the cashier and asked if we were suppose to pay up here or be brought the check. He said that he would bring it to us. When we signed the check and gave him a 25% tip, our waiter materialized out of nowhere, grabbed the check, and thanked us.   Overall, the tea is delicious, price is rather inexpensive, decor is nice, bathroom is clean, but the service is terrible so I give the place two stars. I will never come here again just because we felt extremely unwelcomed. The waiters need to be taught how to provide hospitable service.

The service here is beyond terrible. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner...... We didnt even get served. Several people walked by, and didnt even acknowledge us.... How rude. Literally just kept walking by as if we didnt exist.. Not even one second Ill be right with you. The place probably had a total of 4-5 tables, so being busy wasnt an excuse. Come here if you expect bad service.

Simple place for some bubble tea and appetizers. ??I went with a group of 5 other people. We all had different drinks.  We initially werent sure what to order. What made this place stand out was the amazing service we received from the manager Will. He explained the drinks to us and even gave suggestions for appetizers. Great friendly attitude and fast service.   This is a case where the food was good, but the service really drove it over the top.  **update  This place has gone down the drain a bit. The service is just lacking now. I get youre right by campus and a steady flow of people ??will come in no matter what, but pay attention to your customers and get off the phone. ??The old management was better.

This place is bittwersweet. The bubble tea is good but the food sucks. The servers are really nice though. Come here for bubble tea and great service not the food.

For CP, the best bubble tea. ??I also LOVE it when they have their $2 bubble tea specials. ??Ive never waited any longer than 2-3 minutes for my teas. ??Ive had some of the food here, and its very very simple fair. ??So simple that you can probably make it at home with instant udon or instant noodles. ??The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting, but just stick to the bubble tea. ??Perfectly priced and tastey!!!

Their bubble tea is very good, but it takes time to make them so it isnt a place to drop by for 5 minutes and run, but 10-15minutes. Their food is average. This place is a good place to have a nice talk with friends while sipping bubble teas.

The servers here are rude and unattentive. I got bubble tea to go once with a friend and because it was hot outside we decided to sit for abit and after 5-10 minutes of sitting one of the waitresses marches by and snaps at us that next time if were going to sit in the restaurant we have to get an actual table for here and not to go. ??Even though she was not busy with no other customers she decides to personally come by and bitch at us just for sitting for alittle bit just to cool down.

My original bubble tea go to spot. Never gotten food here, but the bubble tea is good with ample choices of flavors. Wish the seating was more of a coffee shop style with comfier seating, but its more like a small restaurant.

I was brought along here with a huge group. ??There were promises of tea and food. ??I guess thats pretty much what we got.  This is definitely more of a tea shop, that can give you some heated up Chinese food. ??The tea list is really extensive. ??I went with some hot green tea and most of the table went with some sort of bubble tea. ??They all seemed to enjoy their bubble tea and my green tea was warm and satisfying.  The food on the other hand definitely leaves something to be desired. ??Theres a lot of small items and a few larger dishes. ??The buns and spring rolls were what I got to try. ??They were alright. ??Everyone else seemed to enjoy their soups, dumplings and other items. ??If it was left at that, I might bump this to a 4.  Service was ok. ??Stuff came out quick enough and our server was very friendly. ??But the problem came when we wanted to go. ??He merged the check of the various tables in our group. ??Why would you merge our checks if we got split up into 4 different tables. ??That cant possibly make anything easier for you or us. ??After each table went around checking off what was ours, we got our new checks. ??This was all fine until a day later when they charged me more. (Yay for Chase making the charge back super easy though) ??Did they try to merge other tables stuff onto my bill? ??Or were they just trying to pull a fast one and grab a few dollars more? ??Either way, Im always annoyed when someone messes up a credit card charge.  Overall the place is probably fine if you want to stop in and enjoy some tea. ??I probably wouldnt eat anything here again, since it was mediocre at best. ??Service is ok, but remember to check your credit card bill later.

This is one of the few times I really wish there was a the option to give half a star. My experiences have never been truly solid, but theyve never been bad, either. Three and a half, rounded up to four.  The good: Bubble milk tea Shaved ice Vegetarian options Various price points, so if you only want a snack you can do that The food actually looks like the pictures They dont seem in a rush to kick you out Decent hours  The bad: Fruit-flavored smoothies Hot tea is a bit pricey Steamed stuffed buns (same as the grocery store) Takoyaki (maybe some Taiwanese version, but not Japanese)

As I am a true Taiwanese born in the U.S., I know the difference between good taiwanese food/snacks/drinks and bad. The environment here is great, possibly the greatest number of sit-down tables in the active area of Route 1. even free wi-fi! This place gets mad busy during the school year, so its understandable for the sometimes slow catering.  Anyways, you just have to know WHAT exactly to get, in order to make your experience more enjoyable. I notice how, many people are displeased by the food or inconsistency of this restuarant, but I promise you, if you order the correct items off the menu, youll be MUCH MORE satisfied!   My favorite entree/snack/drink combo would be Beef stew noodles/ taiwanese chicken nuggets/ yogurt green tea w. mix jelly SO AUTHENTIC!! I love it. The BEEF STEW NOODLE IS TO DIE FOR!!!   The TenRens located in California &amp; Taiwan make their bubble tea so sweet! yuck, however, the bartenders here in college park are more than willing to adjust the sweetness level for you. As for the waitresses, theyre all pretty cute. not gonna lie.

Ive been going to Ten Rens for years. Its a great place to go in College Park if youve got some hours to spare. The bubble tea is really good you can get it with bubbles, without bubbles or even with little gummies. My friends and I have been here so often that we can give a lot of advice about the place. Some of the servers are kind and helpful so they will give you some space. But a few of them will rush you through your meal and be less attentive. Theyre pretty consistent so eventually you get to learn which servers are nicer than others. As for the food, we recommend the beef soup, the pork stew, the general tsos, the vegetable delight, the broiled eel, the fried chicken filet, the pork buns and the bean buns, the seaweed salad, and the miso soup. The pan fried dumplings and the chicken bites are pretty bland and the kung pao chicken is a dish we didnt like at all. Get the cheese wontons, theyre our favorite. But the appetizer sampler is a good option if you want to try out the rest of their stuff. This place is good for meeting up for a casual lunch date or as a get together spot for you and your friends. Theres games and TV so youll stay entertained even if you didnt come prepared. Finally, theres free WiFi so feel free to bring your laptop if you want to do some work here.  The only thing I do have to warn you about is that theyve started serving less protein than before. They used to give out good portions of chicken and beef and tofu, but in the past year theyve been providing smaller portions for the same price.

Ten Ren is a great bubble tea spot. It is not a great food place. I got steamed buns from here one time and they were literally lukewarm and microwaved. BUT I dont often eat here so it still gets 4 stars for having great bubble tea and tea in general. I love the atmosphere of this place as well.

Hands down the best bubble tea in the area.... or ever, actually. Huge (and by huge, I mean like over 20) variety of choices and their bubbles are spot on. My favorite is the peach black tea... large of course!  Price is a little pricey - $5 for a large (and granted its pretty big) and small is like $3 something (I dont know because I never get a small!) but the quality makes it SO worth it.  I will warn you though - food sucks here. The only thing thats decent is the seafood udon. Nothing else. But I dont come here for the food so whatever.

The food was decent, to be generous. The service was slow and my friend and my food came at different times. The drink is weird. Probably wont come back.

I was told this place had decent Chinese food--and the person who suggested it lost all creditability.  The kung-pao chicken was lacking the pao. It was spicy but the chicken was too soft thus lacking any texture. The sauce was also missing something and below average. The broccoli on the side was a bit uncooked.  The waitress was nice but she took a while to initially serve us.

My go-to for bubble tea. Im a fan of the beef noodle soup, seafood noodle soup, and the kung pao chicken. Im always a happy customer with bubble tea even though it can be pretty pricey. I recommend the green milk bubble tea and Thai iced tea with bubbles. I love that its inexpensive, and the couches are nice and comfy. My only sort-of complaint is that they didnt have ESPN when I wanted to watch a UMD football game, only having 4 channels at the time.

Cant tell you anything about the food or table service, so that last star is more like a silent star than a snatched-away star.   Anyjeezusbubbleteaissoeffinggood, there is a huge tea menu. Im in the process of introducing bubble tea to my colleagues who have not yet had the pleasure of meeting its acquaintance. ??I always pack my lunch, but the times that Ive ditched the brown bag to seek calories in the great beyond, its been for this bubble tea.   To be fair, Im not so sure I could stack Ten Ren up to other bubble tea offerings, but I really like bubble tea generally, and this menu will keep me busy for a while.

Misun suggested we go out for Bubble Tea after we were done with Pho - and since there were no objections - the Pho Force went mobile - and headed over to College Park to check it out.  Ive never had Bubble Tea before, so I was quizzing Misun and Tina about just what these drinks were and so forth. Much time was spent cracking jokes about balls. Our waitress came over to take our orders - and we were laughing so hard over the ball jokes - that it took a minute to get our orders out - our waitress seemed oblivious to our mirth. She stood there waiting - stoic and serious.  I tried whatever Misun had - it was a very light flavored Bubble tea - I want to say it was some sort of Green Tea concoction - but I could be wrong. I tasted Tinas beverage - hers was more like a smoothie - but a very lite tasting one. I think it was Taro. I would try that one next time - or maybe the Raspberry... I almost inhaled one of the tapioca balls down the wrong pipe - that would have been a bad scene!  Jonathan just could not go more than 20 minutes without eating again! The man is an eating machine! In addition to his beverage - he ordered a couple of buns.  The decor is the place is interesting and eclectic. These plastic looking sets of leaves are hanging here and there from the ceiling. Some of the pictures on the wall were framed with this industrial looking metal pattern.  As Tina mentioned in her review - the place is comfortable, cool, hip, chill, laid back! Thanks Misun for suggesting we check this place out!

Theres ALWAYS something wrong with service EVERY time Im here, and Im always back with friends. Its just one of those places. You go, even though you know somethings not gonna turn out right. Its probably because its one of the few options in CP to really hang out, and I must admit, its a pretty comfortable place to just hang out for a bit.  I love the bubble-tea here, although its hard deciding sometimes, since theres about 2398472384 options.   Ive never really felt the food here. My boyfriend is Taiwanese and he says that the food here isnt all too great, or relatively close to real Taiwanese dishes. I have other Taiwanese friends who agree, and so in contrast with other reviews for Ten Rens, Id have say that you can find better, closer to authentic food elsewhere in the DMV. BUT, the shaved-ice really does hit the spot on a scorching-hot day.  As for service.... Wow. Every time, and I mean EVERY time Ive been here, service has been off. Ive been left waiting forever for some kind of condiment for a dish before, only to have my plate turn cold because no one came back. Ive sat and sat before, waiting for an order to be taken. Ive gotten a different bubble tea from the world Ive ordered, and when I was here last week, my server forgot to put my order in.... I found out when I asked about 15 minutes later after the order was placed, and I turned around to see three guys just hanging out behind the counter.   Meh, but Ill always be back for some reason or another.

. ??Ten Rens is a great place to relax and eat! ??  The atmosphere is comfortable and casual. ??They have a large menu of all kinds of teas. ??I get the bubble milk tea, and they never cease to disappoint. ??The chai bubble milk tea is delicious and is the best chai I have had in this area. ??Ten Rens also offers a generous selection of food: soups, authentic dishes, etc. ??They also offer small plates, which I like. ??Try the tea boiled eggs for $2.00 per order (of two eggs) and you wont be let down! ??  I threw a birthday party for my partner here last week and the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. ??They even wrote Happy Birthday and drew some balloons on her bubble tea cup. ??It was a sweet touch. ??  Also be sure to check out their small gift shop. ??They have affordable teas to take home as well as mugs and tea accessories at GREAT prices

Its funny how I never visited this restaurant before when I was attending UMCP. ??I always came around here for the nightlife or hangover foods like Ratsys and Bagel Place. ??This is a great restaurant and quick service. ??It was easy to navigate and select something off of the menu. ??I liked how they taped new prices on the menu. ??Ha! ??But anyways, the eel w/ rice comes with a large size portion ??and you cant come in without ordering some kind of tea whither its bubble or hot. ??I prefer green tea and drinked like 2 pots worth. ??I need larger cups! ??The green tea noodles w/ bean sauce tasted fantastic. ??The sauce really complements the noodles well. That milk toast is like an asian texas toast and tastes like a donut. ??Makes a great dessert.

I use to come here from time to time when I was a student at UMCP. I came here because it was a chill environment, and usually came for the bubble tea. Its not always the best bubble tea offering, but it does the job, especially before Yami Yami opened and gave an alternative. My go to flavors were honey dew, or passion fruit. Jasmine tea is pretty good too.   As far as the food goes, its actually not that bad at all, especially when you think of what else is in CP. The beef stew with rice and beef noodle soup are solid choices. Eel with rice is also not bad.   Overall, I have to give this place 3.5 stars (rounding up to 4). Parking can be a hassle in this area, and its metered, so dont forget that. They are watching like a hawk to give you a ticket here.

Ive been loyal to Ten Rens since I was a tween.  Ive tried countless bubbles teas within the DMV and Ten Rens has everyone beat. This service is hit or miss, but luckily for me its been pretty good recently.   What to get: the nuggets, chicken filet with rice, and yogurt smoothie.

Rude.. I mean, humiliatingly rude. I used to come here daily when I went to UMD for the tea and smoothies, but once the desperation of college life fades, you just dont want to put up with the nonsense anymore. Even their amazing bubble tea is not worth the belligerent-- dare I say racist-- attitudes.  Oh, and the food is flat out disgusting. Got orange chicken once and left the plate pretty much untouched. The steamed buns, especially the taro buns, are always undercooked and sometimes nauseating. Food from here? Never again.

Coming from CA where there are boba shops aplenty, the transition to a sparse boba area has been hard. ??However, Ten Rens as some of the most decent boba Ive had in almost any area. ??The drinks are rather pricey though for what you get.  That being said, their boba drinks are sweetened or flavored with a powder mixture that almost makes me gag from its chalkiness. ??I usually get the cold almond milk tea and if I drink it fast I am okay and the mix doesnt settle too much. ??If I take my time drinking, I literally cough from the texture. ??I tried the hot tea last night and it was even worse. ??The person making my drink put boba juice in with my finished tea drink and it make it thick like soup! ??It was completely un-drinkable. ??If I hadnt gotten the drink to go, I would have returned it.  It is sort of hit or miss here, but I overlook the crappy drinks (and continue searching for the ones that rock) because of the quality of their boba/ bubbles.

This place has very delicious and tasty drinks such as the teas and bubble teas. I blame this place for my addiction to the 8 Treasures tea... so good! They have a good variety of flavors for bubble tea.   Now for the food...   They have great snacks such as the edamame which is salted and seasoned perfectly, seaweed, and taro buns. Their chicken fillet noodle soup is delicious and so are their entrees but ... their is a BUT...   ...any question you ask about food specifics is unknown because they will tell you the foods are prepackaged. If you are health conscious freak like me and want to know if MSG is used , this will bother you. Most likely, prepackaged foods of this kind do contain MSG and this is why I stopped eating here. On rare occasion I will drop in for their 8 treasures tea.   Service is usually good. The girls who work their are very sweet. However, this place is not accommodating at all. They have 2-3 nice spots to sit in: a cozy lounge corner with leather sofas and a low table and a large king-like table with board games. The board game table is always reserved, they will not seat you there unless you have a certain number of people with you no matter if they have a reservation or not. There is a hidden, more private booth to sit in but they said no one sits there which is obviously a lie because you will see their friends sitting there on their laptops, eating. Unless you know someone there, you pro baby cannot sit in the good seats. Because of this, I have stopped going here regularly... Ill just do a takeout of a tea.

One word: Manapua. Yes, they have pork dumplings! I felt like I was back in Hawaii when I bit into my lovely round pork dumplings. The icing on the cake was the Thai bubble tea with taro balls to wash down the little round cakes of goodness.   Lots of college kids here, but it was very quiet and relaxing with the futons, couches and regular seating scattered throughout the place. Excellent spot for Neal, Misun, Tina and I with the Pho Force to settle the strata from Pho VN One now swimming about in our stomachs.   Thanks to Misun for making me aware of this place! I will definitely be back.   Like Tina, my parking ticket mysteriously vanished.

I am Taiwanese and this tea house/restaurant offers authentic Taiwanese dishes and snacks. If you want the real bubba tea, this is the place.

As my friend is a UM student, she took me to her local Boba joint, Ten Rens.  My expectations were rather low as its right by a college campus.  Black Milk Tea w/ Pearls - ~$3.50 - Pricey - Tea was flavorful - ...not too sweet - Pearls were slightly too soft - Regular is only 12 oz? :(  Despite the seedy exterior, the interior of this venue is pretty chill and laid back. They have some talented employees too! ;)

The most annoying thing about this place is their policy against outside food and drinks. The food here sucks, thats why I dont like to order anything from them but I enjoy their bubble tea. There was one time when I went in there with about 4 other friends, we all ordered drinks and I bought a potbelly sandwich from next door. I was half way through my sandwich when one of the waitress came over and told me I had to stop eating my sandwich. I understand that they dont want people to come in and use their space without getting anything but seriously, we all ordered drinks. Another instance was when my friend came in to meet her tutor and she already had a drink with her. They immediately assumed that she wasnt going to order anything and approached her and said you need to order something. RUDE!!!!!  Whats worse is the waitresses favor certain people. I know my guy friend comes in there ALL the times with outside food and they never gave him any problems. If they want to enforce that rule, they should do it indiscriminately with everybody. They pull that kind of thing just because someone gives them better tips, thats just low. ??  Aside from the bad food and bad service, I enjoy their bubble tea.   Oh, and the waitresss voices are REALLY annoying. Maybe its just me.

This is my favorite after work, need something good and different, yet close to my house spots. ??Ive never had the bubble tea but I do hear customers always requesting it. ??Im just not a fan of bubble tea. ??The green lychee tea is good, though, and sweet (not too sweet). ??I love the food, especially the orange chicken and the sweet and sour chicken. ??Its a great place to hang out with your friends or just go to be alone to think.  I also buy good tea from there, too. ??And they have a sake set I am eyeing.

Very cozy nice place for the college students. I used to go here all the time for dinner mostly before going to the bars around it afterwards. I dont eat beef much but their beef stew is fantastic.

Well I drink tea every day, several times a day and I will say thatbthentea here was good however the fact that they charged over five bucks for bubble tea (half tea half milk) is why they get 2 stars. ??3 bucks make more since

When in NYC, I stay away from bubble tea franchises and go to Chinese bakeries for bubble tea drinks. But when in Maryland, ten ren is an excellent alternative. I get green teas and black teas and theyre pretty okay.. Ugh Im just a snob about watered down drinks and its so hard to get rich satisfying flavorful strong bubble teas outside bakeries. But ten ren will do. We also got ten rens in NYC, but I rarely go because of my preference for drinks prepared by bakeries.

I am now a big fan of green bubble tea! ??I cant believe how good it is. There are a million to choose from too. ??I am slowly making my way through the list.  The food here is great as well.

The food is awful! Got the chicken fried rice and shrimp pancake and after a few bites gave up. Theres a really bad after taste and the waiters dont seem to care if you dont like their food! Worst. Food. Ever.

I used to love this place for their bubble tea, but I have found much better in Rockville or even across the street at Yami Yami. Their bubble tea has become inconsistent. Sometimes watery other times the powder isnt even dissolved yet or the bubbles are just bland. Also, their bubble tea is outrageously overpriced for the quality and size. The only thing I can say I like about Ten Rens is their traditional Black Milk Tea which I have found other places cant really get right.   Ive also had their food several times. Came here once to try things out only to find that they were out of almost everything we had ordered. Another time came here with a group to hang out and grab dinner and was completely disappointed due to the chicken being the same consistency as cardboard. Fool me once shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you, Ten Rens. Doesnt seem to be able to live up to Ten Rens great reputation on the West Coast.  Not to mention, if you order your Bubble tea to go you must leave the restaurant once receiving your drink, so if you plan on hanging out make sure to specify for here.

Ive come here several times over the past four years. I used to think their bubble tea was great until more bubble tea spots started popping up in the area... Their hot teas is still okay. Their bubble tea, on the other hand, is disgusting, you can tell they use all artificial ingredients--syrups, powders--since you can TASTE it. For bubble tea please just make the walk across the street to Yami Yami which definitely has the best bubble tea in College Park.  The food is nothing special, they stopped serving their only highlight dish-tofu delight.  They have free wi-fi and their shaved ice desserts are a hit or miss, either awesome or drowning in syrup and dividing checks is a pain..Wow, I never realized how much I dont like this place until I wrote this review. Thanks yelp!

The food is a no. Not bad just not impressive either. Now the tea...different story. Im addicted to the mango black tea (no bubbles). Its good in an obnoxious sort of way. Now, Im not a fan of tapioca (which is what those little balls bubbles are in the bubble tea) so Im glad they give you the option of having them or not.   good vibe going through, they are always playing Sade or some other chill beat. Good for relaxing and zoning out on a hot day.

The tea here is hit-or-miss. Sometimes it has been too watery, even if I ask for light ice or no ice. Their only saving grace here is that there is a wide variety of teas. No other place in the area offers Earl Grey milk tea with tapioca pearls (that I know of, anyhow).  I dont know if any of the food is actually created in-house/from scratch. The steamed buns are served with a portion of the packaging still present, even -- the same thing I can buy frozen at an Asian market.  The staff can be rude. Generally it seems they would rather be playing with their cell phones than be bothered with you. Though they are perfectly willing to take time out to scold you if you are doing something that isnt permitted.

Soooo...Ive been to Ten Rens, or as I call it Ren Tin Tin (old school folks know), twice now. My first time here I got a Thai ice tea - minus the bubbles - and a beef stew like soup (which was super good) and didnt break my pockets. The food is not what you come for but Im a foodie so here it goes...the cheese filled puff thingys were okay...not my type of dish but it was warm and tasty. The bun filled with meat in it was good if you use some of that dough in a soup...just wayyyy too much dough with such a small amount of meat inside. But lastly a MUST is the shaved ice creations they provide...espeically the strawberry one with coconut milk...delish!

The Teas are great--the black milk tea, taro milk tea, green milk tea, and various fruit flavors are great. The bubbles are usually pretty good too. I do have to say, though, that sometimes the drinks are a little more sugary than Id like them to be, but in generally, pretty good!  The food...eh. Dont waste your money--its a little overpriced. Ive ordered the General Tsos chicken here before and it was 5 little chunks of chicken. Yes. 5. The other food is okay, but I wouldnt really recommend it. Then again, its a tea house, so the tea is good.

Ten Rens is a really nice place to get not only bubble tea but also any kind of tea--green tea, black tea, herbal tea, etc. The atmosphere is also great for a date or studying. I myself have come in here and studied for hours on end without ever being distracted other than to ask my waitress for more tea.  While their tea is really good, the food is not so great. They do offer a selection of appetizers and entrees (from steamed dumplings to noodle and rice dishes). I tried their steamed vegetable dumplings, which were okay. The bun took up most of the space, so there wasnt much filling, which disappointed me. I then tried their green tea noodle dish This was the very first time Ive eaten a noodle dish with green tea noodles. It didnt taste any different from other noodles...supposedly, green tea noodles are healthier...? The noodle dish overall wasnt impressive. It was just green tea noodles topped with sauce and some meat. I also tried their szechuan chicken and I the chicken tasted rubbery. Not very good... I now go here just for their tea; I save my appetite for other Chinese/Japanese places nearby.

Their ways of arranging orders are terrible. I dont mind waiting when they are busy. But come on, two sets of guests behind me already got their drinks and gone and they havet made mine yet!? This is unreasonable and stupid.

I am a huge fan of the Ten Ren in New York, so when I visited my sister at College Park, I was esctatic to find a Ten Ren conveniently located on campus. ??There is plenty of seating at this location, and you can either order to stay or to go. ??Free Wifi and board games that look like theyre from the 1970s too.  The bubble tea is very good, although the prices are a little more than Id typically pay. ??There are a multitude of options for bubble tea, hot tea, and smoothie type drinks. ??I get the black tea and have tried quite a few flavors now - the only one I havent liked is the plum (its salty!). ??The tapioca is chewy. ??The hot (non-bubble tea) is great as well. ??The chrysanthemum green is my favorite of the lot.

3-star for drink and service, 4-star for food. The food is very reasonable priced for its decent quality, but many no-caffeine milk tea drinks are purely from flavor powder (red bean, taro, grass jelly in milk, etc). I ordered a grass jelly in milk and asked for un-sweetened, but it came out very sweet, so I asked them if they did not hear my request clearly. The waiter was nice enough to ask the staff for me about it, but it came out that they made the drink from some brown-sugar milk tea powder and not milk, so they cannot make it unsweetened and they are not allowed to make it with pure milk only! Come on, you are NOT ALLOWED to make grass jelly in MILK with milk?! Its not the problem of the waiter or the staff member, but I felt being cheated by the restaurant...

Nice selection of hot teas. Food is very edible. One of the better places to get food in the area. However, the wait staff dont know the first thing about how to serve tables. Food doesnt come out at the same time, and it hard to get their attention.

Ive always loved Ten Ren, Ive been to three locations. However, this location has disappointed me a few times..  1) They didnt have the tapioca bubbles once... and didnt realize it until after I paid for my bubble tea (!!). The girl didnt really care that I paid extra either... Bad communication?  2) They didnt have the coconut jelly! I live for this stuff. Its delicious! Ive actually had to order it before, and its expensive to ship so I understand..  3) The girl was chit-chattin it up with her friend who came by. (Excuse me! May I have my tea please...) When she gave it to me, the bubbles were mushy, there wasnt enough ice and it tasted as if she didnt shake it up enough.  Needless to say, I still come here all the time because the bubble tea is delicious! Yum. The tea is really strong.

I find Ten Ren calming. ??They are very slow and thats a great thing. ??You can spend two hours there over $6 of lavender tea and toast with no guilt. There is also something weirdly awesome about their chicken nuggets -- highly recommended!

Ten Rens has excellent bubble tea. ??A wide array of flavors with tasty tapioca. ??I recommend the mango, passion fruit, or honeydew (milk) teas. ??The service is some of the finest in the College Park area. ??The employees always smile and welcome me when I enter.  The atmosphere is very cozy and is usually filled with college students studying away or people quietly surfing the web on their laptops.  Ive had dinner here once and it wasnt good at all. ??Lack of flavor and rubbery teriyaki chicken was the problem. ??Maybe some of the other dishes are good, but I find only the bubble tea has me coming back for more. ??Another thing Ive tried on a few occasions are the steamed buns. ??Theyre fluffy, but again, have virtually no flavor.

Ive had the several different kind of bubble teas from Ten Rens tea house in their Arcadia location in southern California location. The bubble tea here is just as good, but the price is slightly higher. The food is also pretty good. Just goes to said that they upheld their quality across the country. ??If you like bubble tea, this is the place to be around College Park, MD,

If Im hungry and A. Dont know what I want to eat, B. Am kinda broke, or C. want to go somewhere that is consistently delicious, I will go to Ten Ren. Ten Ren is right next door to Pot Belly and across the street from Univ. of Marylands campus which is why there are always herds of kids in there studying, eating, playing checkers and Uno, or flipping through the latest issue of Asian magazines. Not sure when I actually started coming here since it was a few years back and I cant remember what happenstance caused me to walk in. You enter through an angled glass door and are usually immediately greeted by one of the employees. All of the employees are second generation immigrants of various Asian decent. I ?? know this because I am a first gen Asian immigrant. Shout out to my fellow islanders! Anyway...They ask you if you would like to dine in or take out. I always dine in. The menu consists of clear description of each item. ??The first few pagers consist of a wide selection of teas. Black/green/white teas, oolong teas, and even a few flowering teas. I favor the Osmanthus flower tea and eight treasure tea. Next boba teas! I loove a good boba selection. The only gripe I have is they will not mix flavors. The menu gives a brief somewhat vague description of the item but its okay because each item is pictured. Since I have been there a billion times, I think I have sampled a good amount of the menu. The sweet milk toast makes me miss asian bakeries back home. Its so simple and satisfying. The rangoon is always a good choice. The Dumplings are good but will make you full quickly because of how much meat they put in the wrappers. Also includes a very tasty sweet soy sauce. My go to entrees are the Eel over rice, Meat Sauce with green tea noodles (see what I mean about the vague description?), chicken filet with rice. Just for clarity, the meat sauce is ground pork(I think) and firm tofu pieces in a brown sauce. For dessert, you can get a variety of different shaved ice flavors. I have sampled Sweet Bean with milk over shaved ice and eight treasure shaved ice. Both very sweet but should be shared with others. If its busy it might be a minute before you receive your check. Just walk up to the counter and pay, it will be faster. You can also browse a section beside the counter where they sell teas and teapots. ??They have a card for stamps dont forget to ask for it! I will continue to frequent this place until I leave DC. Dont be surprised to see me there any night of the week!  Parking: There is metered parking behind the building and if you pass Ten Ren on your right there will be a large parking lot on the next block. Also metered. ??  Customer Service: Good. Greeted upon entry and attended well. Really well actually. Employees continually check up on you.  Food Quality: Good mom and pop food thats not really mom and pop. Its good but if your looking for crazy exotic asian food youve never tried this the isnt place for you.  Value: Dirt cheap. Dining Area: Very very chill. Ikea lights and wooden tables. Lots of space. Super Clean. Lots of community games you can play (connect four, dominos, uno, etc)

One of the best bubble teas Ive ever tasted. I highly recommend a visit to Ten Rens.

Ive been to Ten Ren plenty of times and I am never disappointed. The staff is always super friendly and fast. The food is great and the tea is better. I love getting there loose leaf tea to bring home.

Simple place to get bubble tea. Wide selection too. The one in College Park is a nice place to hang out and study. The only thing.. parking sucks... but for students who walk over, its fine.  Food there... errr... its good if youre craving this type.

Let me just summarize, since there are 30+ reviews to draw from:  Bubble Tea: -- Best in College Park, IMHO -- Good chewy bubbles. -- The mixes are not so good (a little watery for my tastes) -- Milk teas are fine (tried Thai iced tea and black milk tea) -- Wasnt a big fan of the Matcha smoothie, not enough green tea flavor. -- Some of their hot teas (non-bubble) are pretty good too!  Food: -- Not that great, but pretty darn cheap. -- Veggie dumplings were good, kind of eggrollish filling inside -- Fried buns were NOT good despite what other reviewers said. Tasted like lumps of deep fried bread batter with overly sweet condensed milk doused over it. I think Krispy Kreme would have been healthier.  Other: -- I wish this wasnt full service, tipping for JUST bubble tea is weird (Plus, I still get my tea in a plastic to-go cup). -- Nice atmosphere, they have board games. Lots of students with laptops studying. -- The staff is friendly/nice.  Overall, Ill come back for the tea and atmosphere. Ill pass on the food (Okay, I might try a steamed Bun. Cant screw that up, right?).

For me it is hard to write a review of College Parks Ten Ren without first acknowledging that there are many many college memories associated with this place. ??  Ten Ren was one of the first teahouse shops to open along Rte.1 , which at the time was a refreshing change from Panda and the local pizza joints. ??  It was here that I experienced my first bubble tea- and while it got me hooked, at times it was hit or miss with the tapioca. ??The same goes with the food menu- however if I was too lazy to cook my own Ramen noodles, I could rely on Ten Ren to serve up a perfect steamy bowl for me. ??  What I liked about Ten Ren was that besides the traditional milk tea, they also serve fruit teas with bubbles. ??There is definitely a special place in my heart for the passionfruit green tea. ??On some occasions they had the extra jello which is like the almond jello you get at dim sum. ??  The atmosphere is laid back, and my roommates/classmates would sit and study for hours, and no one ever kicked us out.

They do pretty well, considering that Im fairly certain that each lunch dish is sauced with a squirt from a giant bag of ready-made brown gravy, which is then further spiced to the particular dish.  And hey, theyve got squishy tapioca goodness.

Excellent longan ginger tea! ??The food is interesting, but the tea is the star for sure!

I was in the CP area and thought why not pay a visit to good old Ten Ren! Ah, its been awhile. Their bubble tea is okay depending on what you order. I got the Black Milk Tea and it was good. Thats always your safest bet if you dont know what flavor is good. The tapioca balls were just right in texture, not too soft not too hard.. its got a little sweetness in taste to them. I remember I used to order different flavors like honeydew, taro, coconut.. etc and they werent very good. Ive had times where I tasted small chunks of powder in my drink :( bleh. I dont explore anymore.   During this past visit to Ten Ren, we actually sat down for lunch. I got the Green tea noodles with meat sauce (because the girls at the next table got it and it looked really good) and my friend got the fried rice and chicken nuggets. The green tea noodles were okay, nothing too special. The chicken nuggets were... just fried chicken pieces. I havent been back here since college but their nuggets used to be really good, very flavorful with the basil stuff! I miss that. One thing that never seems to change over the years is their service... still so slow. My friend came out to lunch for me and it was a long ass lunch! Good thing it was Friday so I think its okay to slack a little? =X

I had my first bubble tea ever at this location. ??It quickly led to an addiction and I spent easily over $100 here on bubble tea in the summers that I lived in College Park. ??I tried just about every flavor on the menu (so many choices!), but my favorites were the sour apple green tea and the honeydew milk tea. ??They even have a red bean flavor here which has been hard to find elsewhere. ??I think they do a pretty good job with tapioca in terms of taste and texture. ??  They have good hours, decent prices, and fast, friendly service.  Whenever Im in College Park, Ill swing by here for a quick bubble tea to revive some memories about my time in Maryland.  Tip: Get a frequent buyer card for the occasional free bubble tea!  P.S. This is *still* the best bubble tea Ive ever had.

After my first Maryland football game last weekend (Terps win!), the boy and I were looking for some quick food but away from some...crazy...um... football fans.   Since he wanted to give me a tour of campus afterwards, we decided not wander too far, and came in here. I have to say, if they had a place like this at Purdue, I probably would have been here all the time.   The bubble tea is fantastic, just the right amount of tapioca. And the food is... OK (hence the 3 stars), but boy do you get portions.   What I really like about this place, is the space itself. Its cute, but not too cute. You feel somewhat chill when you walk in, and there are games to play while you wait (Connect 4, Uno, probably some others). There seemed to be quite a few students sitting around just chatting and playing cards.   Cool little spot.

Look up meh in the dictionary, and youll see a picture of Ten Rens food. ??The atmosphere is fine and the service is friendly, but like many other establishments in College Park, Ten Ren is lacking in good food. ??The taro bubble tea was really watered down and the bubbles were super soft. ??The noodle bowl was uninteresting and paled in comparison to the noodle bowl at Jumbo Jumbo Bubble. ??The veggie dumplings looked beautiful, but were really bland. ??I think if I were here to study or chat with a friend over a pot of hot tea I would like this place better, but the food here is the definition of meh.

The balls are firm and sweet. The green tea is brewed just right. The syrups are tasty and usually added in the proper proportion. My favorite syrups are mango, sour green apple, and pineapple. The 12 oz is curiously small for $3 and the 24oz is $5. They have weekly flavor specials, which are $2 and $4 - this week was watermelon, Jasmine, and something else. Stay away from the smoothies as they are essentially powder blended with ice. For smoothies, head to Yami Yami across the street. The food is the Chinese equivalent of appetizers at TGIFridays - open the bag, put on plate, throw in microwave, and VOILA! You have food...kind of.  Swing in and get yourself a black milk tea or a flavored green tea and blissfully walk the streets of College Park, happily chewing on your balls.  FYI: Free Wi-Fi for customers. $5 minimum for credit cards. Hours during the semester: Mon-Wed: 11am-10pm Thu-Sat: 11am-12am Sun: 12pm-10pm

Well, well, well, turns out that theres a Ten Ren in the DMV. ??What a surprise to know that I can still satisfy my boba tea cravings outside of Mott street in NYC. I was so relieve to find out that the College Park Ten Ren makes a pretty darn good (best in this area) green apple boba tea. The boba-tea here is almost as good as what I get in NYC. I think this boba-tea needs to be shaken or shaken longer (maybe even harder) to get the tea perfectly chilled and slightly frothy. Also, the tapioca balls should have a stronger herbal taste and they should be softer and a bit warm (the warmth is the perfect complement when added to the sweet, icy cold, green apple tea).  Boba-tea aside, the food at this Ten Ren is pretty good and inexpensive. Its the perfect late night spot. I love flipping thru the Taiwanese mags and buying dish after dish on the menu.

I like Ten Rens a lot, but for bubble tea I usually go across the street to Yami Yami.  At Ten Rens I usually get their almond-milk tea (cold) with no bubbles. ??Most of their food is mediocre, but I really like fried buns with condensed milk (YUM!) and my friends usually like their shaved iced dishes. ??If you want real food, youre usually safe with the sweet-and-sour chicken... just dont expect anything outstanding. ??If you want something hot, I love their citron tea. ??The atmosphere is cosy, and its a good place to meet to catch up with friends.

I loved the bubble tea here...the bubble is done perfect here.  They also serve food here....I had the fried pork chop noodle...the pork chop was tender, the noodle was like udon noodle, and the soup was good. ??  Plus....free wi-fi here....and meter parking next to the restaurant. ??  I wish they have this in VA or DC...College Park and Rockville are too far for me to hike out for bubble tea!

This place introduced me to bubble tea, which I think is the most fantastic thing to come along in years. ?? The food is really good too and reasonably priced. ??The atmosphere is great. ??The staff is very friendly and very happy. ??They dont mind if you hang out.  Ten Ren also has a stamp card that they will stamp each time you buy a bubble tea. Buy enough, you get one free.

Im going to try and stay as unbiased as possible, but do note that its difficult because Ten Rens was conveniently located right next to my college. ??And like the reviewer below me, it was my first bubble tea experience.   Pros: ?? -Hours are perfect for college students who want to drink fairly good bubble tea and study -Endless amounts of scrabble :) ?? -Tapioca is perfect -Friendly staff -AMAZING honey dew milk bubble tea -Great place to meet up with a friend  Cons:  -Poorly lit in some areas, which isnt always conducive for studying -Dont like tipping for only bubble tea -The food isnt that great, but its inexpensive

An update, I am in love with their new Oolong green Tea. ??When its done right, its heavenly. ??Its not available in the Rockville store (which has gone down drastically in quality). ??As long as you learn to dodge the speeding cameras on route one...

I come here less for the bubble tea and more for the food, honestly. Its been pointed out that the foods not the best, but hey, as a poor graduate student, I cant be expected to dine at Fogo de Chaos every night. The food may lack in refinement, but it definitely fills me up quite nicely.

Ten Ren has the best bubble tea in College Park. Raspberry Black Milk Tea...mmmmmmm.   Pros: Pages and pages of choices for both regular tea and bubble tea, decent prices, board games to play with while you eat/hang out. Cons: They are really anal about people bringing in outside food.  Note: The snow peas listed on the menu are actually edamame.

Ten Rens is no doubt my favorite place to go in College Park. Its a nice escape from the standard fare of tacky chain restaurants that taint CP. ??The atmosphere is cozy and warm, even on a cold snowy day. It reminds me of my favorite coffee shop back at home. A great place to study or read. Free wi-fi too.  The bubble tea is yummy (I like strawberry myself), and the food is quite cheap. I am always quite impressed at how many different options you have for ordering tea. ??As far as the food goes, I like the sweet n sour chicken and the dumplings.

Ive been in and out of Ten Rens probably more than 20 times before I got Yelp, and Ive tried most of the teas on the menu. My favorites is definitely the Ginger Longan Tea- if you like ginger, you need to try this.

Ill keep it short and simple:  Great bubble tea, average chinese food, friendly service, nice atmosphere, good tea for sale! Seems to be very popular at the College Park location. Prices are a little high for the bubble tea compared to other places Ive been, but I dont gripe. Better to have it than not.   Worth a visit.

Located on Rte 1 in College Park you might not expect much out of this place, but they make amazing bubble tea. ??They offer a great selection of flavors, though Im partial to the raspberry black tea. ??If youve never had it, bubble tea is a chilled tea (and sometimes milk mix) with little bubbles (bobas) of tapioca pudding served over ice. ??It takes some getting used to, but is really quite fun to drink/chew.  Aside from this, Ten Rens offers a great selection of loose tea as well. ??They keep all the flavors in gold bins on the one side of the store. ??If youre not sure what to get, the staff is knowledgeable and can make a recommendation based on your tastes. ??  A few years back when I went to school at UMCP, I ate here with my boyfriend and I thought the food was decent. ??The atmosphere is calm and the decor is traditional and offers plenty to look at. ??The service was great and they prices were reasonable.

I went here the other day with one of my favorite people in the world. It was the best experience Ive had in my life. Our waiter, Jackie, was very friendly and gave us great recommendations. The food here was phenomenal, especially for the price. Definitely coming back here again!

The bubble tea there was quite good.  But ??their Chinese food is quite terrible. Dont let it fool you because its cheap.

5 stars Woohoo! As good as it gets! - Take this into account when you are reading my review.  I have been coming to Ten Rens since high school. I started going to the Rockville store after school and then when I started my undergraduate career at UMD, I knew I would be going here. I would be sitting in a certain spot day in and day out studying or you know...facebooking (popular during the time).  The one thing you have to take into account is the fact that this establishment is meant to be a sit down service restaurant compared to the fast food places around UMD. It may not be perfect compared to places outside of UMD, but really it is as good as it gets especially in the area in terms of the ambiance, the drinks, etc. Also the fact that the have wifi while I could sit and drink something for 8 hours is definitely a plus.  The service could be a bit better, but since they switch employees constantly, it is understandable that not everyone is an expert or anything like that. Also, most of them are college students so dont expect too much from them (they could put down their phones from time to time). I remember a time before they implemented the 2 split checks rule, and it was chaotic so I am a supporter of this rule. There was one busy Friday night there, and I was waiting behind them for like 10 minutes or so when a party of 8 all wanted to pay separately.   Now that is out of the way, lets get down to the actual food and drinks. First thing that this place is famous for is the drinks. Whether it is hot drinks or bubble tea, its good on this, hands down. As for the food....... you really have to know which dish to get. For example, if you order fried rice with chinese sausage (for me it was without the sausage since I am vegetarian), the dish was just killer. However, dishes like vegetable delight or szechuan tofu.... they can do better. It really depends on what you get.  All in All, in terms of the area and the place. I love it. If I go back into the area, this place is my go to spot to hang out. It is not perfect, but it just isnt bad either. Its just as good as it gets.

They make the BEST bubble tea! ??So many other restaurants/stores in the Northern Virginia area offer bubble tea, but they dont make them as good as they do here at Ten Ren in College Park. ??Being a Northern Virginia native, I have to go to College Park for their milk bubble tea.  The tapioca bubbles are always soft, not hard. I love the milk tea, and I always get the Strawberry Milk Tea - my favorite!! ??I always ask for a little bit of ice because I want my cup to be filled with more tea than ice. :)  The dumplings here are good too.

The bubble tea is ok and the food is very tasty, but I feel like it was overpriced. I took a friend here for lunch and we bought drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our total was around $40, which is too much for what we got. Id expect a lot more for $40, which I think is entirely reasonable. Again, its not a bad place, but I wish they catered more to the broke college crowd.

I feel this urge to give Ten Rens a five-star rating because they surely make the best bubble tea Ive ever had in these years. The bubbles are extremely fresh, chewy and slightly sweet. They have thousands of kinds of jelly options which are exciting to go for if you expect something flavoured, but I usually just stick to the bubbles cos for me they are just not substitutable.  Their original black/green/earl grey...milk tea are absolutely worth trying. The smell and taste of tea are pure and fresh, and I can taste that they use REAL MILK to make their milk tea, trust me, I have seen so many other bubble tea places use cream powder which is way more cheaper and contains trans fat.  Waitresses are polite and well trained, there is usually only one waitress taking care of the tables no matter if its a quiet Monday afternoon or a hectic Friday night.

I probably set too high of an expectation for its bubble tea (for those who dont know, Ten Ren is a very well known tea shop, and they have stores across the country -- Ive been to the one at San Jose) and I have to say Im thoroughly disappointed.  After reading all the reviews about this place I drove about 30 miles to give them a try... and heres what I think:  I ordered a bubble tea, green tea milk tea bubble tea, an eight-treasures tea and an order of deep fried bun with sweet milk. ??For a tea shop, Id expect the tea base to actually taste like green tea. ??It was more like a sugary water with a little tea flavor in it. ??The bubble is even worse; its too soft and gooey and falling apart (the taste it not bad though). ??So, what drove me into this place is not what will keep me going back.  Now for the eight treasure tea... it taste alright, doesnt have the best ingredient, but is not too bad given its price. ??It taste a little like chinese herbal medicine but its sorta how it should be, so no complain here.  The last thing I had was the deep fried steam bun (man tou) with sweet condenced milk. ??The bun could be more chewy, but overall its pretty good, with a good crisp on the outside and enough condensed milk to leave you satisfied. ??So, no complain here either.  I guess the bottom line is, if you want some quick Taiwanese fix its a good place to try, but as for bubble tea -- Ill stick with my current favorite: shanghai teahouse 10 minutes up Georgetown on Wisconsin Ave NW.  Oh and I almost forgot - theres a small half-a-step between their exit and the street : dont trip yourself over and end up with a bubble tea facial...

I love the bubble tea here. ??My personal favorite is the Thai iced tea but the passion fruit green Tea is a close second. The staff are really nice and the prices are reasonable. ??Ive been coming here for years but have never actually eaten the food here. ??It looks and smells amazing. ??I keep telling myself that one day, Ill stop by and have a proper meal. ??But it has yet to happen.

The food is pretty good, I had donkatsu, and it was pretty normal. The service is a thumbs down though. They dont check up on you much, and we had to ask for water in the middle of our meal. The pricing is a bit high for an Asian restaurant right next to a college campus. You can find better prices for the same food and better service elsewhere.

Love this place!! My boyfriend and I come here almost every week just to have their bubble teas! In love with the taro flavor! :)

Bubble Tea is awesome! Food is good and reasonably priced. You cant beat the combination!

When I come here, I have the eel and a taro tea with red bean buns for dessert and they are always fantastic. The service can be a little slow, but its supposed to be a relaxing, hangout environment. The food can get pricey as well. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy but relaxed environment in a small party.

Love this place. Fun and interesting food &amp; atmosphere. Try a pot of tea or a smoothie - skip the bubble tea(though my teen son loves that.).Pork buns, cheese wantons &amp; edemamae - grab a game from the shelf &amp; try something new.

The bubble tea here is great. It was the first and the best Ive tried around the area. Im particularly fond of the honeydew flavor. The interior is interestingly decorated and the lights arent glaringly bright, giving the inside a cozy and casual feel. Board games piled up in a central bookcase also lets you know this is a place to sit and relax for awhile.  As you may have figured, they sell loose tea here. The tea is kept in large golden containers and it looks like they have a decent selection.  I tried some food here several years ago and remembered it as good, but nothing amazing. The bubble tea is what I usually go for, sometimes just ordering it take out.

YES! They have salty plum bubble tea here! Delicious. Their dumplings are fantastic too!

I really like this place. ??I dont know alot about bubble tea, but I liked it. ??I am at once intrigued and revolted by the taste and texture of the tapioca balls. ??I had the bubble tea last night. ??  Tonight I went for dinner. ??I had a pot of chysanthymum tea with honey. ??I loved it so much! ??For dinner I had a veggie spring roll and the spicy pork stew with noodles. ??The spring roll was light and crispy and not oily at all. ??The pork was tender and really flavorful and the noodles were done very well. ??  Ill be back here next time Im staying in College Park.

This is my favorite place to get bubble tea, especially when the weathers nice. There were a few weeks where I craved bubble tea constantly for some reason, so Ive been to a lot of area bubble tea places, and I would rather go here than anywhere else Ive been in the area. They have a great selection of flavors, not just fruity ones like a lot of mall stands.   Repeat favorites are raspberry black tea, vanilla black tea, and almond black tea. If youre looking for something different, try the red bean, but get a small one. I really liked it, but too much of it starts tasting gross and I made the mistake of getting a large.  They randomly close earlier than expected sometimes because of UMCPs academic schedule as well as Chinese holidays, so be aware of that.

Try the Sour Apple Smoothie with tapioca - its SO tasty. ??Lip-smacking tasty. ??Perfect for a hot day or even if you just need a pick-me-up in lieu of coffee. ??mm slurp

Just your average cheap chinese place, but the bubble tea and its cheesy Asian-ness atmosphere makes it a great place to relax for lunch. What really draws me to this place is their bubble tea. ??I especially like their lycee green bubble tea, and you cant go wrong with anything else (just avoid the salty plum tea if youre not familiar with that kind of taste). ??They have the lunch special where you can get an entree and bubble tea together for $1 less than the price of each together. ??And if you go just for their tea they have their frequent customer card - get a stamp for every tea you buy, you get 10 and get the next tea free. ??  Because of this place I always go to Ten Ren for bubble tea when Im in NYCs Chinatown.

I usually only review a place because they have something on their menu that is fabulous. This place has tea and snacks. It is the tea that is fabulous. They have a wide selection of tea, including non-caffenated tisanes of flowers, and a selection of inexpensive snacks. Edamame, unagi (eel) - small portions, inexpensive food. They are catering to the college crowd (see the proximity to the U of M campus and the complete lack of parking), so dont whine about the service, just enjoy being able to get a lovely pot of tea, some light snacks and free wifi.

When Ten Ren first opened in College Park, all the Asian girls flocked over with applications to wait tables there - because it was just the cool thing to do. What a brilliant thing for the owners, because thats the real reason why Ten Ren quickly became *the* meet-up place for the after-class afternoon crowds. No no, it wasnt really because of the bubble-tea, or the decor, or the incredibly delicious green-tea noodles (much like how mac and cheese was also incredibly delicious back then too).   It was also where I discovered this flavored ice dish (bao bing? - its basically a pile of ice, with a selection of random fruit, juices, and toppings that you can pile on top of the pile. its a snow-cone on crack). I might have had it before, but I credit this place to my love for it because i think i ate it every day for a few weeks in a row.   Oh, and they also had a corner with board games; this was where i honed my skills in chinese checkers - challenge me to a game; ill beat you any day.  i miss college :)

Ten Rens is my favorite place to go in College Park! I love the bubble tea there- peach matcha and japanese matcha are my favorite flavors. Sometimes Im in the mood for hot tea and they have a big selection to choose from. A downside is that the food is not great. The dinner menu has gotten smaller as well. Its a good place for tea or casual lunch, but I wouldnt go there for dinner.

ten rens teas and ingredients are all imported from taiwan. so you cant get any more authentic than that.  they boil their bubbles in brown sugar and soak it in honey for ~1 hr before served.   The teas (green, black etc) are brewed daily. They also brew it throughout the day to avoid running out. so its as fresh as it can get.  the food is pretty good, it has some of the popular taiwanese dishes. The chicken nuggets were DELICIOUS! its a must have. I also recommend the chicken filet with noodles.  The price is really good for the portions.  you can basically get a entree + bubble tea for less than $10 since they give you a $1 discount when you purchase an entree with bubble tea.  its a definite go.

You dont go here for the Chinese for thats for sure. ??My friend got an egg roll here once, $2 and it was pretty bad, small and not tasty. ??The bubble tea is fairly good, depending on who is mixing. ??So quality can vary alot. ??Overall not a bad place to hang out, the interior is nicely furnished.

The sweet black milk teas (somewhat along the lines of chai tea lattes) are my favorite - these include the Vanilla Black Milk Tea and the Raspberry Black Milk Tea. Pricier than Starbucks per oz. however, plus the waitresses insist on bringing your orders to the table, forcing you to tip just for tea. Theres only one couch area (2 couches facing each other, fits about 3 people each) and the food is mediocre. Free wi-fi is a plus though, and theyre open later than Starbucks on Friday and Saturday nights.

THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST TASTING CHINESE FOOD EVER! I have never tasted such nasty food, can u even call it food? And the stuff they serve is definitely microwaved...ugh disgusting!!

I have always loved Ten Rens. Their bubble tea is the first I ever had and it is the best so far (the only place Ive found equivalent is in NYC in Chinatown). The food is somewhat generic but is delicious. The taro buns are awesome! The menu used to be a lot better, but they got a new chef a few years ago and things changed. Unfortunately, they took my favorite item off of the menu (curried chicken with rice, better than any place Ive ever had it). If not for the generic menu, I would give this place 5 stars.

If anything, Ten Ren serves consistent, quality tea. ??The consistency of the boba (tapioca balls) in their bubble teas, however, are anything but consistent. ??Ive been to Ten Ren franchises in San Francisco and Singapore as well as the Rockville and College Park locations. ??Ten Ren is a great store to purchase loose tea leaves. ??But half of the time the tapioca in their bubble tea tends to be either too hard or pulpy. ??Good bubble tea shops will replace the tapioca balls when they become stale. ??Perhaps it is because of the popularity of its franchise that Ten Ren will serve poorly cooked or stale boba. ??One might say that Ten Ren is a victim of its own success.

Superb selection of traditional teas, comparable to nyc tea houses. ??Incredibly attentive and friendly service and a warm and cozy atmosphere. ??If I had attended uni at U of M this would have been my spot. ??A great find.

Ten Rens is the best place in college park. It has a great atmosphere for dates, studying, friendly catch ups, going out for tea, lunch, snack, dinner, whatever. They even have a collection of manga and games if thats your thing. (Ive played connect four and cards there on a few occasions and its been lovely) They have the only food of quality in college park. They have a delicious vegetarian menu and a ton of meat options. They also have nice foods to study with like soups. If youre into tea (which im not) this is the place is even better for you. They have an impressive selection of teas, bubble teas, milk teas and all kinds of drinks. Ive had a couple different bubble teas and Ive really liked them. (they arent the sweat smoothie mall kind, this is real TEA). HIGHLY recommended. Not 5 stars only because they give you TINY paper cups for water, and they NEVER come to refill it. I always just end up getting up to go to the front to fill it myself. (but its not that big a deal)

Ten Ren is to tea as Starbucks is to coffee. ??Ten Ren is an international teahouse chain founded in Taiwan that also serves bubble tea, which is an unique sweet desert-like beverage with tapioca balls that originated in Taiwan in the 1980s. ??I like Ten Ren because the quality of the bubble tea is somewhat consistent, unlike some local stores that change ownership frequently. ??Im not saying the quality is exceptional, but you know what youre getting and you can usually expect good bubble tea with less surprises. ??Unfortunately, the prices are sky high and everything is overpriced, especially since you can get better bubble tea at street corner stands for something like 50 cents in Taiwan. ??The ambiance at this College Park location is fantastic for meeting up and hanging out with friends. ??This particular location is superior to the Rockville location, which doesnt have any seating.
