I have little experience with Jamaican food but it didnt matter as it was delicious. It wasnt just the variety of dishes, or the flavour, but everything tasted so fresh. The chefs make everything from scratch so it takes a little while but you wont regret the wait.  Our table of four had the Vegetarian stew and a side of curried cauliflower, Coconut fish (one salmon, and one tilapia) cooked well and with a nicely seasoned non spicy sauce, and a Curried shrimp that knocked your socks off with flavor. Big hit. I had the coconut tilapia (selecting plantains and steamed veggies as sides) and Id have it again...YUM. The macaroni and cheese side dish was a winner too. Their bean and beef soup is so flavourful! ??They have a bean and chicken but the beef one is better. Prices are great for the quality. We wanted to try more but were too full. Will just have to come back to the welcoming smiles of the very friendly staff and chefs.   Place is a little hard to find on a lower level of an apartment complex, but that just adds to the adventure. Make a trip!

Completely lives up to its name. My husband and I live in DC and often find ourselves creating reasons to head to college park so that we can dine at UF. ??  Staff: amazing, personable, kind, polite, make you feel like family   Environment: unassumingly located in the bottom of an apartment building, completely relaxed and filled with yummy scents of Jamaican food.   Food: my favorite is the chicken jerk burger with plantains instead of fries. The Rasta Pasta with shrimp is another favorite, as is the seafood soup. Always fresh and made to order, served in to-go containers.   Length of stay: all things made to order so itll take a good 20 minutes to get your food. We dont visit when were in a hurry or if we are we can order ahead.   Happy dining!

This place is great!  The food is delicious and the staff are unbelievably welcoming. The chef introduced himself to me and explained the menu options to me (my familiarity with Jamaican dishes ends at beef patties), and told me he can make any variety or combo I would like. The owner even came and sat with me to tell me a little about himself and the restaurant.   I will definitely be returning because they sincerely appreciate all their patrons and make it known in both their food and hospitality.

We were looking for some good jerk chicken and found this place on yelp. But gps took us to this apartment complex and it was inside one of the building plus they didnt have any sign ??board, which was unusual and hard to find. We got jerk chicken, goat curry and bread pudding. Everything was good. They even gave us some soup to try. Overall nice simple Caribbean food. If we would have been living in those apartments we would have visited the place frequently.

I was in College Park during lunch today and stumbled upon this awesome Jamaican restaurant ??Great choice... -4 stars from my experience.   I had the jerk chicken and oxtail combo and my sides were mac &amp; chesse and curry cabbage. I ordered a beef pattie too-so greedy! Moving along..  Babyyy..... lets talk about this oxtail though-Delish! Perfect flavor! Jerk chicken was very tender however lacked the jerk seasoning and flavor I like. Not bad though. I enjoy spices so it might be much better for someone else.  Cabbage-delish! Mac &amp; cheese was okay.  The beef in the pattie was good nice spice kick but I didnt enjoy the pattie itself honestly but i still ate it   Customer service was greatttt! Friendly convo and I was even given a sample tasting which I did not turn down.   Definitely will return. I dont usually type up long reviews unless my experience was not enjoyable however, i had to make sure I didnt miss anything.  Paid about $21 for everything.

Damn I see why they have 4.5 stars on 200+ reviews. The food is fresh, the service is great and the place is small but quaint. They got Jamaican music playing...good experience. The location though, what?!...trust Yelp and go to the address on the app. Go in through the apartment building and its towards the back. Youll see it. Not your typical restaurant location. Pleasant surprise. You will be skeptical but go in and try it.

Ok, so normally when I want Caribbean food, I just make it myself because I had not found a good place. My family is from the islands so I am fortunate to know what good Caribbean food is suppose to taste and how to cook it.  But this place... Lets just say I have found my new go to Caribbean restaurant! The food is soooooo good! I had the Curry Chx and Brown Stew Chx Combo with curry spinach and rice and beans.  But the food is not the only greatness in this place. The customer service is AMAZING! I was so impressed! They were very welcoming and even gave me updates regarding how much longer I had to wait. So needless to say, I will DEFINITELY be returning for some great Caribbean food when I dont feel like cooking it. ??If you havent tried this place, then what are you waiting for! Lol. You wont regret it.

Three and a half stars for food, rounded up for excellent service.   Most Caribbean food is not designed to look beautiful. Stews and veggies and rice (especially when served in styrofoam containers) simply dont photograph well. Take a look at the photos here and you will most likely agree. I generally take more photos of my food, but simply couldnt this time. Honestly, though, it was also because I couldnt resist the delicious smells any longer.   I ordered the brown stew and curry chicken combo with curry cabbage as my side. I love cabbage in most forms, and this preparation was excellent. Based on other reviews here, Ill stick with the side vegetables as a main meal next time and will be happier than I was this time.   What made the chicken less than amazing? It wasnt the sauce, which was good. It was t the portions, which were huge. It was, as others have noted, the bones. My first bite of the brown stew contained a bone shard. So did my second. My third contained no bone, but unexpected cartilage. The curry chicken had been cut with more care, and the portions really were large, so I concentrated on that side of my plate and vowed to never ever attempt a fish dish.   The cabbage, though. Yum! Also the coco bread and the ginger pineapple drink. The drink is very sweet, as it contains pineapple juice, but I added some water and life was good.  I was offered a taste of their hearty bean soup while I waited for my food to be prepared. I was asked repeatedly for my opinion on the soup and on the rest of my food. Everyone working that day was happy to offer suggestions and share a smile or two.   I know that Ill be back!

Was in the neighborhood searching for a bite and found this place thats described online as a hidden gem. So, I thought Id try it...    couple of hiccups.... where do I begin... First Yelp online ordering Eat Street... ??EPIC FAIL  Place my order at 8:30 for pickup. Arrived at 8:55 the order was not even taken care of. I had to reorder and sit like an any other arriving customer... and paid up front through Yelps Eat Street so whats the point of that?!? Supposedly a fax was suppose to come from Yelp to resturant... doesnt make sense especially on a Friday evening. Probably didnt come thru because the resturant phone was off the hook. (See below)    Second, ?? finding this place was ridiculous if you are not fluent with this area. Not only is it at the bottom of an apartment building, which is fine, but the navigation into the building was not clear. I, a woman, was at both the front and back doors off a locked apartment building after dark. I was finally led in the right direction by a resident of the building.   Third, the resturant phone was off the hook and they didnt know it.kept going to voice mail as Im calling from outside..of a locked apartment building...in the dark. ??I had to alert them of their phone problem and noticed another customer had experienced the same issue.   Now... once you are in the right place it should be smooth sailing. The resturant is located at the bottom of the building...look for the green awning that says Marketplace. The young guy, greeter/cashier was so pleasant and I hated he received my frustration but the service was very slow and unbelievable.  Keep in mind I originally ordered my food at 830pm. I have the online receipt as proof. My order was finished at exactly 938pm and that is not even an exaggeration. On everything an hour later and I didnt order oxtails or something that had to stew, bake or marinate for hours... ??I ORDERED SHRIMP N VEGGIES   Food... again I ordered the curry shrimp with cabbage, veggies. Side of plaintains and bread pudding. What frustrated me most was how they did not acknowledge the mistake. Instead they fulfilled orders of residents passing through and phone orders...all while I sat in their face waiting on some shrimp.  I am typically a very fair person. In my two years of Elite Ive only left two or three three stars..I am.hard to disappoint - check my record! ??But this was not a pleasant experience for the reasons mentioned above.  This resturant fell short in communication and service on this day.   The food and pineapple ginger juice was overall good. I thoroughly enjoyed the cabbage. ??They also ??had a small band playin live music. I may return if i got hours to blow and look forward to upgrading the review.

TL;DR: Never again.  I entered an order on Grubhub at 6:24pm, and I didnt get my food until 8:24pm. I wouldnt have been so frustrated , except 1. The estimated delivery time was 30-40 minutes, which was why I selected the restaurant to begin with, and 2. the estimate once the order was placed said it would arrive between 7:40-7:50pm. I dont know whats up with their delivery staff or service, but they need to get a handle on the delivery time discrepancies.   I also had difficulty reaching the restaurant. I called for an update at 8:10pm, but could never get an answer. I gave up and tried to call Grubhub, because maybe something happened. Luckily, the driver called to ask how to find my building. I gave him the exact same directions as the ones I included in the special instructions. Great attention to detail there. ??I ended up needing to call them back to bring me missing food, and they dont have an answering system. The message just tells you to try calling back in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later, I was able to speak to someone who said theyd send the missing food right out.   Then, when I did get the food, it was ALL wrong. We ordered tilapia nuggets and they were nowhere to be found. I ordered a brown stew/curry chicken combo and got curry chicken and curry goat, which I dont like. When the food wasnt wrong, it was sloppy. There were no straws, utensils, or napkins at all. We ordered 2 smoothies of different flavors, but one came in a to-go cup but the other came in what is best described as a soup cup. Neither was labeled, so we had to guess which was which.   As for the food, it was OK. Certainly not worth the cost or the hassle. The rice &amp; peas was bland, as was the curry cabbage. The mac and cheese is actually penne ... its not stellar, but its ok.   In comparison to other Caribbean restaurants in this area (Jerk Pit, Negril, etc.), Unforgettable Flavors leaves a lot to be desired. I will not be taking chances on this place again.

Great catering experience! Chef Neville provided excellent communication when planning the event and made everything go smoothly. He personally delivered and set up the food, so I didnt have anything to do other than turn on the sterno burners.  And the food was great! All the guests were raving about how delicious the menu was and after stuffing their faces, quite a few nodded off very satisfied.

That moment when you step into a restaurant and feel like, um, did I step into the twilight zone *cue music* LOL  Ok, so this little restaurant is nestled deep in between the Seven Springs Apartments! The last place you may think of looking for a pretty decent place to eat. I met a few of my Yelp friends here for dinner one night and it was quite the experience.   The set up was quite an eye to behold to say the least with cute little lighting decor made out of plastic shot glasses and plates...Old school cafe style tables..and other little odds and ends scattered through out. But hey we didnt come here for the decor we came for the food!   Ok, so moving on...Im going to start this off by saying honey chile just go for the mac and cheese! The ooey gooey melted goodness of cheese in between the al dente macs was delish!  Spinach...AWESOME! I had two servings of it! Jerk Salmon was unfortunately disappointing because it was completely overcooked and tasted a little like it had been in the freezer to long.  West Indian Patties; I tried the chicken and it was pretty darn tasty! Flaky and buttery crust with spices that were appeasing to the palette.  Shrimp and Chicken Rasta Pasta didnt disappoint. Jerk Chicken Pasta was a little overpowering for my taste and the chicken was overcooked.   Overall, the experience was good. There is some work to be done but the dishes that were good were very good. I am optimistic that they will improve and strive on to be on of the best spots in PG County! They were out of Ox Tails this time so just maybe Ill just have to mosey my way back on over here to try out the ox tails and get more of that good ol mac and cheese and spinach!  Happy Eating Folks! ;-)

This place is in an apartment building &amp; confused me as I pulled up. The confusion left once I walked inside. The place was very clean &amp; welcoming. Lovedddd the young woman working at the counter. took her recommendations since some of the things I ordered was out(Good sign for me). EVERYTHING from the beef pattie to the entrees were amazing! Out of the way for me to get but Ill definitely go out of my way for it.

Im not the best cook well really, Im an incredible plater. ?? With not being the best cook Im really big on taste of food, specifically the lingering taste of good, great food. Ive concluded that to achieve the lingering taste of great food the seasoning has to be impeccable. Simply put Unforgettable Flavors checks all the boxes. Not crazy about the location but arent gems always difficult to find.? Never been to Jamaica before but have by way of Unforgettable Flavors. Chef well be back again and again.

One of my friends comes here every Friday with his 3 roommates, and they know the people that work here on a first name basis. They are literally regulars and it was so nice to see how much they like the people who work there like them and vice-versa. Most people hate college students, but the people at Unforgettable Flavors were SO happy to see us.   The service is leisurely, so not the place to go if youre in a rush. Its also hard to find. But the food is really delicious. I got the jerk tilapia with mac and cheese and plantains. It was ~$10 for a full meal. The tilapia was great, the medium heat was at a good level of spicy (could have been a little spicier, but I prefer that over it being way too spicy).   Come here if youre in the CP area. Theyre super nice, the food is great, and its just the perfect little hole in the wall.

One of those nights when you just dont know exactly what you want, so I checked my bookmarks to see what I might try... Its a lot easier to find than some reviews mention, as there are now signs both on Cherry Hill Road and in front of the building where the restaurant is hidden in the basement. Pretty small, with only ten tables, but brightly lit and lots of colorful Island art on the walls. I was immediately greeted and introduced to the menu. I ordered the jerk chicken (medium spicy) with curry spinach and mac and cheese ($9.95), and a bottle of Jamaican ginger beer ($1.50). While I was grooving to the reggae they brought out a free sample of their 16 bean soup. Rich, complex, turned out to be a harbinger of what was to come. The spinach was not spicy at all, but subtly seasoned with perfect texture and no excess water. Id pick it over the creamed spinach at Ruths Chris. The mac was actually penne rigate, whose ridges served well to hold the cheese. Pretty good, but next time Ill try a more authentic side.  As others have noted, the chicken had been chopped with the bone in, leaving a few splinters to watch out for. That may not be a bad thing, as you would want to chew slowly to savor the gorgeous complexity of the seasoning, which allowed the subtle flavor of the Scotch Bonnet peppers to show along with just enough heat for a good scalp sweat. It definitely makes the top 10 in chicken preparations, right alongside Sardis. All I would have needed was a bottle of Red Stripe beer to take me right back to the beach at Montego Bay. IRIE, mon.

Ive never had authentic Caribbean/Jamaican food before, so I wasnt sure what to expect. While I wasnt very hungry at the time, my friends were, so between the five of us, this is what was ordered: - jerk chicken with plantains - shrimp or chicken rasta pasta - west indian patties - brown stew and curry chicken - curried cabbage - 4 orders of the house-made pineapple ginger drink  My friends agreed that the plantains were pretty good, and that at least we knew the plantains hadnt been sitting under a heat lamp since we saw the chef take a couple of plantains sitting in a basket after we put in our orders.  The jerk chicken, brown stew, and curry chicken had pretty good flavors. The curried cabbage was quite good, especially since the cabbage retained some crunch. The West Indian Patties were ok, but the one that just came out of the kitchen was much much better than the one sitting in the warmer for a bit.  The rasta pasta was ok, but not that flavorful.   The pineapple ginger drink definitely had fresh ginger since it had quite a kick to it. I like the pineapple ginger drink the best because I like fresh ginger.   Service was a bit forgetful and slow at times, but they were very nice and welcoming.

Been a fan of Unforgettable Flavors since I first heard about the cozy spot a couple years ago and have visited many, many times. The hospitality that Chef Neville brings is comforting and graceful. However, I wont be back ever and neither will my family. And unfortunately, this review is based up on a visit from my sister, a previous experience I had, and the lack of communication in addressing our concerns. And since no one has responded to my email to Unforgettable Flavors, Ill be short and transparent here:   - My sister got food poisoning from uncooked piece of tilapia at UF.  - She called several times, but the only response she kept receiving was that the chef was at at catering gig.  - Walked in one day to get plantains (before my sisters bad food experience) and they were not completely cooked.  - Walked in another day and was able to speak to general manager, but she wasnt that helpful and I did not like her approach.   - Emailed my concern and no response.   As an advocate for small businesses - I am disappointed. Although I am concerned about the safety and well-being of people and consuming cooked and healthy food, I am more disappointed about the lack of communication. You would want to same courtesy if this were you.  My purpose of this email is not to deter anyone from eating here - I view Yelp as another channel of outreach since no one has been responsive from UF.   I fancied this restaurant, but we wont be back! My family enjoyed eating here but this is unfortunate and I hope you all find a way to not only respond to comments of praise, but criticism as well.   -M

Today was my first visit. ??Ive been looking for a Caribbean restaurant to replace the others near me (Jerk Pit and Weekness for Sweetness) that have been disappointments in either food or service as of late. ??I will say that Im impressed with almost everything they offered. ??The menu offers a nice selection and offers some things that the other nearby restaurants do not. ??My meal consisted of plantain, braised curry spinach, curried shrimp and Caribbean bread pudding.  First, placing the online order was simple and quick. ??The cafe was a little tricky to find because its located in the basement of an apartment complex and the signage was somewhat confusing but I was able to get to it. ??I walked in and was immediately welcomed by the cashier, which was a shock but a pleasant surprise. ??The cashier showed me my food, which looked good and fresh. ??  The plantain were cooked just right, no sogginess or greasy taste. ??Normally I like mine a little sweeter but it was a fine mix of tart and sweet. ??The spinach and the shrimp were delicious. ??They curry wasnt overpowering and you could savor the flavor of the food. ??After I finished the shrimp, I had leftover curry and mixed it with some of the spinach. ??I enjoyed every bite. ??The bread pudding was not the traditional bread pudding. ??It almost had the consistency of black cake but was flavorful. ??The cashier recommended that I heat it up for about 20 seconds, however, I ate it cold and it was still delectable. ??Overall, I enjoyed the meal and the customer service. ??I will definitely add this one to my list for future visits.

This was our first visit. ??I had Jerk Chicken Pasta, outstanding, Curry Chicken, order was the best we have ever tasted and ordered a Jerk chicken wrap to take home. ??We spoke to the head Chef when he came out to check on his customers. ??Very humble guy that has a special gift in the kitchen. ??Outstanding unique dishes and I want to sample each and every dish before the year is out!

The food was delicious and the service was awesome! My husband and I tried the brown chicken/oxtail combo and the coconut fish. The food was very flavorable and I felt like I was eating food from the islands. We will definitely return soon! I look forward to trying other dishes there.   Oh and dont be concerned about the location. It is in an unorthodox location (in the basement of an apartment complex), but I felt safe. The place stayed crowded with a variety of people. You wont be disappointed.   I dont know why Yelp wont edit my comment, but I meant to say flavorful and not flavorable

This is the best restaurant Ive been to in awhile. The service is great!!!! Theyre all very friendly!!!!!!!! I ordered the Rasta Pasta with chicken and shrimp, it was about $9.50; it was so beautiful, it made my tastebuds dance on my tongue! I recommend it to everyone.

The food here is SO good! The chef is such a nice man, he does a nice job in making sure your wait is comfortable. Every time I go he offers a taste testing of the days soup. The soup is always delish. My favorite item on the menu is definitely the Rasta pasta. The patties are also pretty delicious. Make sure you check them out!

As far as being categorized under good traditional Caribbean food. I dont get it. I think this place is great for people who want American dishes like pasta and mac n cheese in ethnic restaurants. I personally do not care for this, because if I truly want that, I can go to Boston Market or some other traditional American semi-fast food place.   Thats just my own bias, but on another note, customer service was good, staff is super friendly and welcoming.  The food:  The salmon was over cooked. The Rasta Pasta, I thought was just okay, thought it was going to be more like an Alfredo ??with jerk meat over it. ??Instead they used the multi color corkscrew pasta that is typically used for pasta salad tossed in oil?? Personally, I make a very good Alfredo and so I dont think Im being too critical. The jerk chicken- little dry pieces of minced meat sprinkled on top :0/  This is one of the rare occasions where Ive been to a restaurant where the vegetables and side dishes like the cabbage and spinach are better than then main entrees. I love Caribbean beverages and they have a plethora of ??exotic juices and sodas.  The patties along with the cocoa bread are something to write home about, both the chicken and the beef were some of the better items to get from this restaurant. This place is nice if your close by, but its not a place I would fight traffic up Route 1/Baltimore Avenue to get to.  They were out of Oxtails when I visited. I plan to go back just for that and of course those sides!

WOW! ??The food is just pure perfection. ??I am giving this place 4 stars versus 5 because I feel it is a little overpriced for the amount of food you get. ??The location is also very hard to find; its actually inside the Seven Springs Apartment complex. ??Now lets get back to the core of this place, the amazing food. ??I have had LOTS of curry goat and oxtail but let me tell you, this place tops them all. ??The chef will adjust the spice for you and the sides taste amazing! ??I dont even like vegetables but this place gets me to eat the curried spinach and cabbage. ??YUMMY! ??I will also highly recommend the Shrimp Rasta Pasta. ??I have never had Rasta Pasta before but since I discovered this place 2 weeks ago, you better believe I have crushed it about 3 times. ??If you like Sorrel, definitely grab one from Unforgettable Flavors. ??It has just the right amount of ginger to make it stand out as an A-Class drink. ??What I also like about this place is that when you go there, they will give you a sample of the soup of the day and lawd, eating the soups there reminds me of home. ??On the weekends, they offer a 16 bean soup with chicken; TRY IT! ??You will not regret it. ??I am just so happy to have found this cozy, cute place and will continue to support this business. ??Hats off to the chef!

Very delicious meal!! We tried the curry chicken and it was well seasoned and delicious . They were so nice enough to offer me some cowfoot soup while we waited . Man! That soup was the best, wanna lick me fingers and my toes ! Lol .  Customer service was exceptional. Thumps up guys !!!

Remember that time you went into the first level of your apartment complex and enjoyed some of the most delicious freakin Caribbean food youve eaten this side of the Mississippi?   Chances are you dont remember that unless you reside in the Seven Springs Neighborhood of College Park.  Im not gonna bore you with going on and on about how much a hidden gem this place is, or ??how - if you didnt have Yelp, ??youd most likely never end up here; Ill mention it in passing like I didnt even mean to mention it at all.   What Ill say is that with 129 reviews and 4.5 stars; Unforgettable flavors does not only impress, with success, they gratify in excess. (Yes, that was unNECESSar??y... oh God, its still happening). I regress.   Its not the classiest restaurant youve ever been in: A few 90s style tables, a handful of oddly oversized booths that seem like theyre from the 80s, and a counter with a glass front and a kitchen divided with a Wilson size wall. #HomeImprovementWhatWhat  Dont pay attention to the decor, just focus on the flava.   Rasta Pasta: We got both the shrimp and jerk chicken renditions. The shrimp was the groups resounding favorite. Tri color pasta, wonderfully plumped, with tender near perfectly cooked shrimp in a creamy yet flavorful sauce. The jerk chicken pasta was a bit too overwhelmed by jerk spices in addition to the chicken being slightly overdone.   West Indian Patties: Similar to Jamaican beef patties. We tried both the chicken and beef ( as they were out of the spinach). Thin flaky pockets conceal bold flavorful mixes of protein. The aforementioned beef was fantastic. Not too much of a bite, but a wonderful punch of Caribbean spices. The chicken was mixed with a yellow curry sauce which was enjoyable and surprising.   Macaroni &amp; Cheese: One of the best adaptations Ive had. Throw macaroni to the wind though, this DJ is spinning with penne. Everything about this mac and cheese is what you want in life.   Spinach: Plain awesome, one of our favorite dishes.   Jerk Salmon: The only dish to really disappoint. Salmon was unforgivably overcooked.   Curried cabbage: Good albeit could have used a little bit of salt and or acid.   Cocoa Bread: Im not sure if they bake this Class A addictive substance in house, but if they dont... I want to know their supplier. ??I NEED THEIR SUPPLIER! Take a deep breath... ok, Ive just been really without a good hot soft roll for a while now, and I feel like... ahhhhh... leftovers. *Eyes glaze over*   User Warning: The first time I went to Unforgettable flavors, I got the Jerk Chicken. (Now, I know this is a culture difference but) They cut the chicken up bone-in with a cleaver. and I was picking through sharp shards of bone to try and eat the chicken. If I ever did decide to order it again, Id ask if they could do it bone on without cutting it up. Im not sure why people do it that way, but to each their own.   Cant wait to go back.

You know how you normally have that one person in your life thats always willing to try a new cuisine? Yeah, well, Im not that girl. I stick to what I know, so if it turns out to be horrible, I wont be disappointed. ??On this day, I got together with some folks to try something a little different for me, some authentic Jamaican cuisine. Sure, Ive tried a few Jamaican dishes in the past and I really wasnt that enthused to go back and try more. ??Well, Unforgettable Flavors has made me a believer! ??   Its so true that you cant judge a book by its cover, because I wouldve never expected a tiny carry-out spot (It does have a limited amount of tables for customers to dine) thats located in an apartment complex would be cranking out so much flavor in their food. Clearly, they chose the correct name for this restaurant because the flavors here are unforgettable! ??The best way I can describe how to get here is if youre coming from Route 1, make the 2nd left into the Seven Springs Village Apartments and after you pass the leasing office, the restaurant is to your right on the 1st level. Look for the neon red OPEN sign.  Since it was a group of us that were dinning, we decided to try several dishes. The appetizers we decided on were the West Indian Patties (chicken and beef) and I enjoyed both equally as well. The group joked about how every culture basically has their own version of a pocket with something stuffed in it...a pocket of deliciousness as one person put it. In addition to the the patties, we ordered the coco bread....SOOO GOOD! ??Fresh, soft and warm, just the way I like my bread. ??For our entree we tried the Rasta Pasta (shrimp and chicken) and it was pretty unanimous that we enjoyed the shrimp version better. Very flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. We also ordered the Jerk Salmon that was accompanied with THE BEST SPINACH IVE EVER EATEN AT A RESTAURANT...IN MY LIFE! ??Its a must try! The salmon was flavored rather well, but EXTREMELY overcooked, which made it tough to eat, literally and figuratively. ??Wanna know what else was EXCELLENT...the mac and cheese! ??ORDER IT! So cheesy, so delicious and a kick of spice. ??The curry cabbage lacked the flavor I desire when I eat cabbage, so thats not on my radar to order in the future, but the coconut fish was rather tasty. ??  I washed all that down with a homemade pineapple ginger beverage. ??If I didnt have diabetes before I got here, Im pretty sure I had it after I left. It was extremely too sweet for my taste buds. Nice flavor, but too sweet. ??The young lady at the register that assisted us was really nice and very eager to please. Customer service here was great and they seemed to genuinely care that we enjoyed our food. Sure, the food takes a little while to be prepared, but with food this good, its worth the wait! ??  Bob Marley playing on the speakers, fun island-y feel pictures adorn the walls and THE BEST Jamaican cuisine Ive ever tasted...seems like a no brainer to me! Dont just take my word or the other 4/5 star reviews, try it for yourself. You can thank me later! (Youre Welcome)

The food was SPECTACULAR!!! Was travelling from NY down South .....just passing thru. The hostess was super friendly. ?? It was 8:45 PM (they were closing at 9) .....kitchen was closed we kinda figured we were too late to order. ??Chef Neville said na na na what do yall wanna eat. They cooked EVERYTHING fresh on the spot. EVERYTHING was AWESOME..... SERVICE was AWESOME. If you are in the area you gotta try. If your NOT in the Are, it is worth the trip!! Check emout

This place is amazing. ??Ive only been twice but everything I have tried has been outstanding. ??Seafood soup and Rasta pasta are particularly notable. ??The staff is also incredibly friendly and welcoming. ??Definitely my go-to lunch spot any time I am in the college park area.

My taste buds were dancing for oxtails. Unfortunately, they were not on the menu that day. I ordered curry goat &amp; shrimp, rice &amp; beans and cabbage, GOOD!!! Gotta return to try the oxtails.

My wife and I visited this restaurant while in DC and it was excellent on a multitude of levels. The chef came out and personally greeted us and then graced us with a five star dining experience. Great Service, Great food, excellent flavors. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

First let me clear that the location is at the Seven Springs Apartment Complex, I kept driving around looking for it...  The food was AMAZING, as well as the service!! ??So sad that I dont leave near by; but I can assure you everytime Im in town for business or pleasure will make time to come by and eat!!!!

Excellent customer service! Very friendly, great music. Just tasted my food. Its soo delicious. I got cheesy mac n cheese. Flavorful spinach. And spicy curry chicken. Omg dem oxtails doe. A bit pricey. But you wont be disappointed! And Im coming back. Best believe

Wonderful little Caribbean place. ??It is hard to find in the middle of an apartment complex. ??But the service is very friendly and the place is small but bright and sunny. ??It is more of a carry out but there are a few tables. Loved the veggie curry.

The jerk chicken wrap is fantastic and their fries are always hot and crispy, which is great. Their pineapple-ginger drink is also really delicious.   Their other food is just fine to me-- nothing super amazing. Ive had the coconut fish, the brown stew chicken, the jerk chicken and their island smoothies (overly sweet). The best reason to come here is because its convenient.   The service is pleasant but slow-- sometimes Im quoted 20 minutes, and then I get there and still wait another 15-20 minutes, which seems silly, especially for something like a wrap.

Yum...its hard to find a Caribbean restaurant that has great food food and excellent customer service. ??Ever hear that person making noises while they eat because the food is so good. I used to laugh at those people, but I became those people last night as I ate my spicy beef patties, braised oxtail and curry goat combo...and my roti . Chef Neville was extremely courteous and took care of our needs as we waited (we arrived starving). We received red bean soup and cake to try. The cake was delicious, it was lemon with white chocolate shavings on top... a nice surprise. I apologize for no pics but you probably understand why. We will be back.

Great Jamaican cuisine.. we had the jerk chicken wrap and brown stew fish. Both were delicious. Neville seems like a down to earth guy.

I feel like I went to unforgettable flavors on an off day. ??Upon arrival, the service was great. ??The people are very friendly as they take your order at the counter. ??I ordered the curry shrimp and jerk chicken combination with curry cabbage, rice &amp; peas. ??My food was okay, but I felt like it should have been marinated longer. ??My mild jerk chicken tasted like it was stewed with a little bit of spice thrown on it. ??I dont imagine that it was ever on the grill, and the curry shrimp just didnt have enough flavor. ??By the looks of the pictures that my fellow Yelpers have posted, I know the experience could have been better. ??Unfortunately, I didnt get to taste those unforgettable flavors.  3 Stars!

I went here last Friday night and quite liked the service as well as the food. The place is very small with limited number of seats. Most people who live in seven springs order and take out. The price is very reasonable and they also gave complimentary soups for tasting. The lady who took our orders was very nice. And the food was pretty delicious. We ordered a goat curry, a curry shrimp and coconut chicken. We also ordered a lemon meringue cake for dessert. We liked the experience and Ill surely go back for more.

The last time I had oxtail this good it was in Crown Heights Brooklyn. Mmmmm. This place is hard to find - go to the address and then its basically basement level of an ugly apartment building. What youll find inside is lovely! Oxtail, curry cabbage, rice and beans, spinach, coconut curry shrimp.  All lick your fingers good. The chef is a delight and Im already planning my next trip to ikea just so I can go back!

Ok SO...I only HATE this place for turning me into a finger licking, marrow sucking barbarian. Where in the world do I begin?   Well, I drove past that durn building twice because it is literally on the bottom floor of an apt complex and I clearly dont read for comprehension the reviews that said that. Lol Its ACROSS FROM THE LEASING OFFICE. Hope that helps. :) When you walk in every one in the place says HELLO and welcome. I sat myself. The service here is SO good. They are the sweetest. My waitress was very helpful and explained everything on this menus spin on old Caribbean meets a new Jack chef. I ordered a chef crafted dish meaning it wasnt on the menu but he made it anyway. The chef, VERY nice...I was expecting some old seasoned guy. Nope. Young guy comes out and says I can make you jerk chicken that will blow your mind. Well....KABOOOOOM! Best jerk in Maryland I think. And Ive tried ALOT!   The Mac and cheese is a culinary WIN WIN WIN! Plantains were ok, a lil dry but I didnt care and good rice and peas. The dish of jerk and ox tail mixed was beautifully plated and as good as it looks. The 2 ladies behind the counter and chef checked on me EVERY 7 minutes no exaggeration, they rotated. Lol and the chef was so humble and you can tell he loves what he does. ??It was nice to be treated so appreciative of my patronage.   All Im gonna say about the Lemon meringue cake I tried is if you dont get that, BRUH.... ur doing it wrong.   I will be back as often as I can with EVERY Jamaican food craving I have. Go and thank me later.

Sorry but maybe its only the head chef that creates the unforgettable flavors because my experience would be pleasurable to forget. Upon arrival we were barely greeted with an hello and greeted with a straight up what would you like to order...we were first timers...can we get a menu or be directed to a seat first? *As a tip to the restaurant, if customers are dining in they should be offered glasses of water ??just for good measure.* The beef and chicken patties we received were cold...like, out the fridge and nuked for 5 seconds cold - unacceptable. (Once they were warmed up they were quite delicious - 1 star for that alone.) We both ordered the Rasta Pasta with jerk chicken. This place gets a star just for the amount of chicken that they put in the pasta because lets be real, most restaurants give you more pasta and starch than the main entree or protein. The chicken wasnt really jerk flavored, it was just seasoned; I was expecting a lot more spice. Nibbling off of the beef patty while trying the pasta helped to add some of the desired kick. The atmosphere would have been better if music was played. The customer service from the staff was enthusiastic but lacking. At one point, one of the staff mentioned that the restaurant is generally take out only, like it was an excuse for why things were going wrong with their customer service and our meals. It seems like the entire staff was in training, or maybe they just have a lot of work to do in the restaurant business. We wont be returning, although I did mention that if we did live in the complex we would have tried different dishes over time, but since we dont live there it would seem to be a waste of our time to come back.

Literally one of my favorite places in the area. Such great food and even better food. Truly feels and tastes like home cooking. Love their coconut chicken curry and jerk chicken. Its in such a hidden corner...if this place had even a slight bit more visibility, the line would be out the door.

Chef Neville and his team at Unforgettable Flavors outdid themselves once again! Last year, it was my nephews college graduation. This year, we celebrated my sons first birthday with 35 family members! Everyone raved about the food. I cant say enough about what a pleasure it is to work with this caterer for your most important celebrations. I look forward to working with them again!

I ordered the jerk chicken/chicken brown stew platter with curried cabbage and spinach coco bread and a homemade pineapple and ginger juice for delivery. She informed me it would be about thirty minutes and I received an order confirmation text to my cell. I also was offered the option of tracking my delivery progress via the app zoomer. I didnt sign up but I thought it was a good sign of their dedication to delivery. My order got to my home in less than 30 minutes without any issues.   The food was gorgeous. It looked like it couldve been just plated at a sit down restaurant. It tasted great. It wasnt garishly spicy but it definitely wasnt bland. You could tell thought and effort wasnt put into making sure the flavor/seasons were cohesive. The coco bread was soft arm and fluffy. I got the impression all the food was freshly made and not as if it has been sitting around for hours under heat lamps.   The ginger pineapple juice was fantastic! It wasnt watered down in the slightest and the ginger wasnt overpowering. It was a really good blend of flavors.   Considering the quality of the food the platter combo is a pretty good deal.

My favorite spot in college park! Chef Neville deserves a Michelin star for the stuff he makes straight out of the seven springs apartment building complex! He greets you as soon as you walk in, asks what youre in the mood for, goes back to the kitchen and makes some of the best Caribbean food youll ever find. Its a must go: affordable, entertaining, and, most importantly, delicious.

Very difficult to find. It is in the Marketplace sunken in the basement of the apartment complex building listed in the address on Yelp.  Food took about 15 minutes to come out- jerk chicken was moist and bone in with exquisite sauce with mild heat. Slightly overcooked in some areas and gummy. Curry cabbage was delightful and the curry spinach was outstanding. Very homely food in an atmosphere you would recognize from other Caribbean places: artificial flowers, bright colored walls, TV on, plastic utensils and styrofoam boxes for plates.  Service was very friendly and courteous. Overall, quite good but perhaps too far out of the way for me to warrant the sojourn.

I called ahead to pick up an order. He read it back to me and told me the price. I get there and they made the wrong thing. I then had to wait for them to correct it ??(I didnt mind) but the price was different from what I was told. OK. I ordered the jerk chicken wrap with fries and plantain. Although the wrap was good there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING jerk about that chicken. It was rotisserie chicken in a wrap. I was HIGHLY disappointed. The plantain was just OK because it tasted s bit burnt.

Okay and so I spent most of the day running errands. During my travels I met a young man who told me about a spot that had ??delicious West Indian Cuisine. ?? Me being a cook myself I normally dont do this but seeing as though Id been out so long I would not have time to cook so I jumped in with both feet. I wasnt hungry so I ordered my husband something called Curry Chicken Rasta Pasta. ??Yep, I said Curry Chicken Rasta Pasta. ??I got there and it went pretty quickly. I picked up my order and I went to the car. Curiosity would have killed me before I got home so I sneaked some of my husbands food. I got back out of the car went back in and ordered myself a meal. It was absolutely delicious. ??I would have given you 7 stars. ??To Chef Osain, ??the Rasta Pasta was to die for, you are going to go far. Best wishes always

This place isnt much in terms of decor but the food is as true to its name, unforgettable . I forgive them for being out of the homemade cucumber and ginger drink which was phenomenal. The pasta dish was perfect! I have had better curry goat but the oxtail was absolutely delectable. Best Jamaican food by far! The boy working the counter is the cutest things ever. He is what makes this place. As we waited he gave us a sample of soup. Wow! I know where Im sending my bae next time Im sick!

Ive ordered take out from here a few times. The food is good, probably worth a 3.5 rating. However, I chose to round down because of the unreliability of the restaurant. For example, with my last order, placed through GrubHub, my boyfriend and I both ordered entrees. After waiting for about 30 minutes for a text to say its ready, instead I get a text saying we were refunded for my entree. I understand that restaurants run out of items, but someone has always called to let me know and see if I wanted a substitution. Had someone just let me know they didnt have what I wanted, I could have made other arrangements for dinner. Thats just poor service.

But why are they far from me? Maybe to save my bank account?  Ive been meaning to try this place because of the great reviews and well, I love Caribbean foods  So I stopped on the way to work with my son and tried the brown stew, jerk combo, spinach, cabbage. My son got the fried tilapia and Mac and cheese.  Why was the fried fish better than my southern grandmothers?!  The Mac and cheese was made with penne and had a little hint of spice, but not spicy. My son, who is a Mac and cheese connoisseur, felt it was some of the best he ever had.  The brown stew and jerk were good, but the pepper cup was even better. It was spicy but not unbearable, but most importantly it had flavor. Im getting like five next time!  I also got the bean soup which was good, but I was expecting loads of flavor and spice from  The spinach and curry were so good!!! I could even forego rice and just eat these.  Im excited to try the jerk burgers and oxtail etc etc.  Most importantly, the chef ??greeted us as we walked in. Everyone was so kind which puts it over the top.  They even have pastas, which I cant wait to try. Im sure theyre fantastic since the Mac and cheese was so good.

My wife and I decided to embark on a journey in trying this place for a Saturday lunch. I use the word journey, because thats exactly what it was when we were finding our way there. This is located inside an apartment complex, and if you are using your GPS, it might lead you to the wrong side of the building.  Upon entering the complex you want to look for the Marketplace. Our GPS took us to the wrong side, and a helpful tenant allowed us to pass through the building and showed us the restaurants location.  This brings us to the restaurant itself. The interior was decorated well enough, and the soft Jamaican beats in the background were a nice touch. All in all, they do a nice job in capturing a Jamaican feel.  I ordered the Curry Goat with rice/beans and curry cabbage. The dish itself was delicious! My only wish was that it was a little hotter. When it was brought to me, it felt as though it had been sitting for a bit. But nonetheless, it was a very good dish and I would highly recommend both this dish, and the restaurant overall.

I live in the area and happened to stumble upon this place today! Form the moment I walked in, the staff was immensely accommodating and generous. The head chef took his time to explain every menu item, entree specialties and characteristics of each dish. I ended up getting curry chicken to go and the chef was nice enough to make it extra spicy for me. Thank you so much!

It is our first time here . We had jerk chicken , stew chicken , and they are awesome ! We have two entrees , with two side dishes, two bottle of water , and a piece of lemon cake , its only 26 bucks !!! The lemon cake is unforgettable ! You gotta have it ! The service is great , the lady in the front desk and the chef are very friendly ! Definitely a unforgettable dinner !

I walked in the door with 3 mins to spare before closing and still got to order my food freshly made. Very kind of the Chef and his staff to accommodate me at the last minute. No other Jamaican restaurant Ive been to can top this place!

When I pulled into the apt complex I assumed my GPS was wrong. I had driven around in circles and decided that this experience was not worth my time so I was heading out...then I saw a tiny Marketplace sign leading to the basement of one of the buildings. Id read so much about this place I figured Id take my chances.   I stopped in around 2pm on a Friday afternoon and I was the only customer. I was greeted warmly by the ladies behind the counter, and the entire place smelled REALLY good, so I figured we were off to a good start. I ordered the coconut fish, curry cabbage, and braised curry spinach. While I was waiting I was treated to a sample of their chicken bean soup. It was a deliciously savory concoction with yummy bits of pulled chicken...it was so good I polished it off before taking a picture! If you order the full size, it is hearty enough to make a full meal.   The food took 10-15 mins, which is another good sign (I hate pre-warmed, pre-made dishes...especially since fish tends to dry out). The fish was tender and very, very delicious. The flavor of the coconut and the Jamaican spices blended SO well together, without being overpowering. The cabbage was excellent, just a hint of sweetness, and the spinach was equally good. I will definitely be coming back! (During daylight hours only...not sure I would want to hang out in this area at night...IJS!)

Although we had a little trouble finding this hidden gem, the food, atmosphere, and staff made the meal unforgettable. Upon walking in, the staff welcomed us warmly. The Head Chef and owner, Neville, also came out and greeted our group with a huge smile and personally catered our orders.  After a short wait, our meals arrived. The Jerk Tilapia Rasta Pasta was downright fantastic. The fish was cooked perfectly and had great flavor depth. Also the pasta itself was spicy enough to satisfy my taste buds but not overpowering. I also ordered the Bread Pudding, which smelled and tasted incredible. I will definitely be returning to try out the other dishes.

Delightful food and staff.. gives a homie feel. ??Oxtail was good..

Stopped here while in the neighborhood on a recent ikea trip. Found the place on yelp and decided to check it out because of the awesome reviews. When we got there (its on the lower floor of an apartment building) we didnt expect much out of the place to be honest.   We got the jerk chicken (obviously) and we were super impressed with how well it was done. We also had the curried cabbage and the curried spinach both were on point. I preferred the cabbage though while my boyfriend dug the spinach.   Also, after living in Miami for a few years I became addicted to fried plantains. These were pretty standard, which doesnt mean they werent good. They are very good especially since there are many fewer opportunities to get them up here.   And last but not least the guy behind the counter was awesome! He made the whole experience for us.   All in all, the food for the price in the location is definitely a winner.

Went here because of the yelp reviews, this place is truly unforgettable. The flavors were original and rich! My girlfriend and I truly enjoyed this place. The service was good and the people were very Pleasant. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try food with a Caribbean vibe.

My experience was awesome from beginning to end. From the moment I walked through the front door I was greeted and made to feel extra welcomed. ??I had never been here before and wanted to check it out plus I had a craving for jerk chicken lol. The guy behind the counter asked if I had ever been there before and I told it was my first time. He then said just let me know and you can sample whatever you like from foods to drinks. He did just that! I finally decided to get both the jerk and curry chicken (both are excellent) and I was on my way before I knew it with my hot food. If you want great Jamaican food with excellent and fast customer service, stop by this spot. I will be back for sure.

Pretty good. I came here around 830 on night to find the place had a decent amount of people ordering and waiting. The man was very friendly with his customer service. I decided since this was my first time I would try to brown stew and oxtail combo for 16$~. I got rice and beans and steamed veggies for sides. The portions may have been a touch smaller than those old school styrofoam containers but it didnt bother me. ??So the brown stew.. Im thinking because it was towards the end of the night maybe thats why the chicken seemed a tad old.. And honestly I didnt taste much flavor. The oxtail was good though. It came with maybe four pieces of meat and a tiny drizzle of sauce. Im not a fan of beans unless they are like mushy mushy.. So the beans were a little hard and not good to me but thats just me. I like to get rice and beans with those really soft beans. The steamed veggies were so simple but prob my fave thing. They werent overlooked and had the right amount of salt and possibly butter on them?Next time I gotta try the jerk, rasta pasta and Mac and cheese then update my review.   The place is a little hard to find. Once you enter seven springs youll see the gym in the middle well the marketplace/mall is the lower level of the apts to the right of the gym.

We had a lovely experience ??at Unforfettable.Flavors. The flavors were absolutely ??unforgettable! ! The service was wonderful and the complimentary sample of bean soup ??tickles your palate! I want sweet success for this small business. The food was affordable and delicious.

I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews but once I tried the food, I was underwhelmed. The hubby grabbed dinner for the family this evening and we ordered the ox tail and goat combo, jerk chicken with oxtail combo, red snapper, and tilapia nuggets. The best thing out of the entire meal was the oxtails and that was less than average in flavor. The snapper wasnt seasoned and tasted a bit rubbery. The sides were also lackluster. The rice and peas were OK but the spinach, curry cabbage and macaroni and cheese, please NO! The nuggets were....nuggets. Nothing special- just bite sized fish pieces dropped in hot oil. The goat was like rubber taffy. Overall, the food lacked flavor and wasnt reminiscent of the flavors that I anticipate from Jamaican dishes that I love. We also like a spicy kick in our Jamaican food and that was non-existent in everything. To top it off, I asked for the ginger pineapple drink and I had to toss it after I tasted it. The drink was more like sugar water with a hint of ginger. Im so, so, so disappointed that we spent over $70 for this food. This was a disappointing experience but you never know how good a place is unless you try it. Ive been there, done that, have the t-shirt, and wont be returning. The name should be changed to forgettable flavors because the food tasted more ??like the spice rack was taken hostage.

I was craving oxtail and didnt want to cook it. So, I checked Yelp for spots in the area. Im a critic, and there are some places that I would NOT recommend. But this place surprised me! After driving around thinking the place didnt exist, and then calling, I finally found my way there. I wish the signage was better- more first timers may find their way there. The gentleman that took my order was young and SUPER polite! (Thanks and congrats to his parents!) My order didnt take long, and that oxtail was everything. The curry on the cabbage caught me off guard, but it wasnt bad. And the sorrel was yummy too. ??Ill be back for sure, and you should try it too!!!!

This place is literally a hidden gem!   Its in a lower level commercial section of an apartment complex building. GPS will get you to the neighborhood just fine and following signs to get to the restaurant shouldnt give you much trouble. The place itself is well decorated and youre immediately greeted by one or more of the staff. Already it feels like family in here... so genuine!  So were looking thru the menu trying to decide what we want and we ask a few questions about suggestions. Still deciding, were offered some Jerk Turkey. Yes you read that correctly. Were brought a plate of Jerk Turkey that theyve prepared for some Thanksgiving meals (as Turkey day was the following day of our visit) and my goodness, hands down best Turkey Ive ever had. Marinated thru and thru, just enough spice... its amazing! Were also provided some samples of a couple of ginger drinks. Sorrel ginger and Pineapple ginger... both spot on delish!!  Now down to my actual meal, I had a jerk chicken plate with steamed veggies and peas and rice. Those are traditional sides for Jamaican food but believe me they have sides for everybody. Some things that seem a bit more soul foodie. Overall, the variety of the menu is pretty large for a Jamaican spot in the states, honestly! Anyway, the jerk chicken was just as amazing as expected, sides complimented well and a decent beef patty to go alongside made for a nice treat as well.  Whenever I visit my fam up in MD again... this IS my first stop hands down!

So I have mixed feelings about this place. ??Ill start off by saying the service is absolutely fantastic, and everything Ive ordered from here is super fresh and high quality. ??As you can read in several of the reviews, the patties, sides, and soups are much more flavorful and satisfying then the regular entrees. ??For me, none of the entrees have enough seasoning, no kick. ??Besides that, this place is definitely nice. ??The soups are out of this world.

Excellent food, the oxtail and curried Goat was on point, very tasty and tender and the portions are very generous, you cant go wrong, go check them out, Thanks Chef Neville and all the Crew for the most unforgettable flavors!

Please patronize this establishment. You wont regret it. I promise you.  One of my coworkers found this place on Yelp and a group of 10 or so of us came here for lunch. I will say that the service was slow, but it was good to know that the food is cooked fresh and our server provided us with some free appetizers because of the long wait. Every single one of us enjoyed the food and we made a mental note to order food ahead of time so we wouldnt have to wait.  I decided to place a large catering order here to bring back to my office a couple of weeks ago. Shortly after hanging up the phone with the person taking my order, the chef called me to go over the menu and confirm everything that needed to be ready within a few days. I thought that was a great touch. I requested that the order be ready by 11:00 am, with the expectation that it wouldnt be ready until 11:30 am since our first experience with service was slow. At 11:00 am on the dot, the chef called to let me know that the food was ready! Impressive!  When I arrived, I made small talk and raved about how impressed I was with the food. ??I wanted to be sure that I had enough food for about 20 employees. To thank me for my business, he gave me 20 free sodas! Talk about great customer service! Its the little things!   I order food for my office once a month and we always have leftovers. This is the first time that my coworkers ate everything! Everyone was so impressed with the authenticity of the food and how delicious it was. We especially loved how spicy the jerk wings were! This place is the truth!

I was so excited about lunch at this restaurant I forgot to check in lol. The owner was very friendly, we walked in and was not only greeted by him but he sat us and went over the menu with us, he told us about the top sellers and the different flavors. He poured us some ice water and turn on some music to set the mood lol.  While looking over the menu he sat two small cups of soups on the table for us.....the soup was delicious...I forgot to order some to go... We ordered and waited about 10-15mins for our food. I ordered the curry chicken and brown stew chicken with curry cabbage and rice and peas, my husband ordered the jerk chicken wrap with fries. The food was Amazing, everything was good, I ate as much as I could lol. I also tried my husbands wrap but it was too spicy for me, he asked for Hot....and it was...he loved it. His lovely wife and Im assuming his daughter stopped by the table to thank us for visiting... Very friendly. At the end of our meal he brought out a box of cupcakes for us to chose from. I picked the pineapple and my husband picked the coconut. Best cupcakes weve ever had. Even took two home for the kids. We will definitely be returning to the place it was truly unforgettable.

What a hidden gem. Every time I visit, theyre always on point. The service is always superior to all other Caribbean restaurants. ??It does help that the food is excellent as well. Wish I lived closer. This would be a daily stop. For authentic island food, please visit. They will take great care of you. Oshay is awesome. He is the host. They also give complimentary soup tasting. delish!!!!!

The customer service at this establishment is very bright and welcoming. This was my first time coming here, and as soon as I entered, I heard someone greet me all the way from behind the register. I decided to try the oxtail and brown stew chicken combo and it was delicious. Ive had this dish at other establishments and it can very easily be too salty. I like that my food was spiced well, very flavored but it wasnt over done with salt. I also tried a beef patty which was really good. I had a sample of the chicken bean stew which was savory and so delicious but unfortunately I didnt get it because I was already too full from what I had ordered. That will definitely be something that I try the next time I come by. I did read in some other reviews that people said their food took a very long time. However that was not the case on my visit. My food was ready in less than 10 minutes. I did also see other people coming in to pick up orders that they called in and everyone seemed to get in and out seamlessly. They were also quite busy that day as well. ??Definitely try this place out!

THIS WAS AWESOME. ??Chef Nigel met us as we were looking at the menu, ??then helped us pick out an amazing lunch.   I had the curried coconut shrimp with curried spinach. ??Both were incredible. ??My wife had the jerk chicken with curried cabbage. ??Both meals were awesome, ??but we both liked the spinach better than the cabbage.   Chef came over to talk with us. ?? Hes a funny guy with an obvious love of what he does. ??He gave us some of his home made hot sauce to take home with us.   Try the pineapple ginger drink. ?? Amazing.   We had lunch here and dinner at the Inn at Little Washington. ?? This was by far more memorable and well be back.. ??This was good enough to possibly warrant a drive from our home outside Philly... just to eat here.

I got the jerk chicken, curry cabbage, and plantains. My boyfriend got the jerk chicken, mac and cheese, and steamed vegetables.  First of all, weve never had good jerk chicken, so the background knowledge of what excellent jerk chicken tastes like is lacking. However, we both donate taste buds and they were saying that this chicken was so freakin delicious.  Sides were really good. I got the curry cabbage based on other yelp reviews and they didnt steer me wrong. It was tasty with a nice touch of curry flavor, not overwhelmingly curry. I didnt think the plantains were dry like other reviewers, they were great. My boyfriend liked his mac and cheese and vegetables (a man of few words).  Lastly, the prices were very very reasonable. If this place wasnt such a hole in the wall, they probably would and could charge so much more. And the employees have excellent customer service. They were really nice and always had our water topped off. The chef also came by to check up on us. If were ever back in DC well make sure to come again.

The food at the restaurant lived up to the name! ??We ate at the restaurant, and hired them for catering a wedding reception. ??I liked that the restaurant offered traditional Jamaican food as well as fusion dishes. ??That way you can choose from more than just the same 5 meals that are at every Jamaican restaurant. ??As far as the catering is concerned, everyone worked very hard to make sure the guests were happy. ??Chef Neville was very professional. ??He listened to our needs and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. ??The guests commented on how good the food was!

Hard to find at first but im a regular now. I stay away from the quasi american fare and stick with the caribbean flavor. However, the mac and cheese as a side is really good. I recommend stopping in for a lunch special. They really know their flavors, no pun intended.

Honestly? I just dont get it. I really, really dont. This restaurant has been raved about on Yelp and I just cant find any reason to vote it highly. I had the Jerk Chicken Wrap and it was truly a resounding Meh. Fills the space, but for the cost Ive expected better. Ordered curry goat and it was about 20% meat, 80% bone. I nearly cracked a tooth!  Ive ordered from them about three times-- theyre in my apartment complex, so its about as quick for delivery as you can possibly get. But they also have really odd times. Theyre closed Sunday and Monday, and even then they have weird hours on their normal days. They dont keep to their posted hours, often going home at 7 or 8.  Their website also needs a complete overhaul. Many of their most popular items arent listed on their online menu, you just have to know of their existence-- the Jerk Chicken Wrap I ordered isnt even mentioned... no wraps are!  Its possible Im ordering the wrong food here. Maybe Ive just had absolutely terrible luck and if I just ordered the right thing it would be heaven on earth... but I really doubt this is the case.  With a high price, interminable wait times (even when the restaurant is empty), and average food I really cant recommend it.

Soooooo maybe I just went on off day. I was very much looking forward to being overwhelmed with great spices and jumping favors, especially since I had been craving Jamaican food for a while. However I was disappointed. I ordered the curry chicken with Mac and cheese and rice and peas. The Mac and cheese was my favorite part and thats not even Caribbean! Lol. They used basmati rice for the rice and peas, something I was not a fan of. And the curry chicken barely tasted like curry..there was no punch, no kick. The reviews are what brought me to this place so maybe Ill give them another chance in the future. Besides the food though, the customer service was superb!!!

It was confusing to get to the location since it is located inside a gated apartment complex (Seven Springs). After driving in circles three times (curse you map app *shakes fist*), we finally found it thanks to other yelpers.   The food was absolutely amazing. We had the curry goat and oxtail (one of their special dishes) with sides of plantains, spinach, and rice with beans. The nice and overtly friendly waiter even threw in a present for our first visit - beef and pea soup in a cute little cup. The curry goat and oxtail were cooked to perfection! Melt-in-your-mouth goodness! What was really odd was the fact that the rice with beans and spinach were served cold. Perhaps it is a Caribbean thing. That really threw me off because I am so use to eating my meals served hot.   The best thing about the place was the hospitable waiter. He was on point! He catered to our every need and checked up on us quite often. It was weird how this other lady took three dollars from our cash payment (including tip) when our waiter was the one who took care of us. She took it without his acknowledgement. It looks like a family-run business so hopefully they take care of it among themselves.   Overall, it was worth the trip because the food and service were amazing!!!

I must say that I rode pass the entrance of this place a couple of times, because I never would have thought it would be nestled in an apartment complex. ??Thank goodness for Yelp because I went back to the review and looked at the pictures as well as read a few reviews and tips to find out exactly where this restaurant was located.  I definitely agree with a previous reviewer that says this is a hidden gem nestled away in an apartment complex (located right across from the pool). ??I know they must get a mad rush after people finish swimming. ??Swimming always makes me hungry. ??Anyhoo ... back to the review.  I have been here twice and on both occasions the chef personally came out to the table to describe the menu and why they chose the flavors they chose for the entrees of the day. ??I was impressed both times.  The food is delicious and authentic home cooking. ??Im from Washington, D.C., however my friend is from St. Croix and he says it tastes like traditional Ital cooking.  My daughter who is an extremely picky eater loved the Rasta Pasta.  The first time I went I got the jerk chicken wrap with fries. It was delicious. ??The jerk was flavorful with a little heat. ??The french fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just like I like them.  My friend got the vegetable curry stew both times. ??The stew is loaded with veggies and flavor.  The second time I got the jerk tilapia. ??Flavortown U.S.A. ??I was given a nice size piece of fish and my sides were mac &amp; cheese, along with rice and bean. ??The fish was very flavorful. ??I love that the rice and beans were not mushy and my rice was not stuck together.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely go back again.  The chef said they are working on getting a bigger sign at the entrance, so no one else misses the entrance.

Looked up places to eat on YELP &amp; Unforgettable Flavors was highly recommended. This customer service was excellent from the time I walked in the door. ??We ordered the Jerk Salmon with basmati &amp; curry cabbage &amp; the Indian curry stew. The food was fresh, hot &amp; yummy! Everything was seasoned very well! We sat down an ate while Bob Marley played in the background I can honestly say I will be back very soon! Unforgettable Flavors left a lasting impression.

Yelp definitely got it right this time!! This place is def a hidden gem with the BEST jerk Ive had in the area this far! The beef patties were finger licking! I enjoyed the curry cabbage and the curry goat. Other reviews said the Mac n cheese was good but it was just ok for me. The lemon meringue cake was awesome as well! I cant wait to return and try everything on the menu!!!

Very friendly staff. Jerk chicken mild and spicy recieved thumbs up from my girls.The girls really liked the cabbage. Im making 2nd trip there tomorrow to try the curry chicken and curry shrimp.

Best Caribbean food you can get in the DC area. The flavors are very rich. Service was excellent. The oxtail and goat curry was on point.

Awesome food came before closing they were very accommodating! Ordered curry chicken and Ox tail was very pleased, food awesome my family dusted off the two dinners! Coming back

When I ordered the jerk chicken entree for the first time, I had no idea my expectations would be surpassed. Unforgettable Flavors is incredible. You gotta try it.

I have eaten here several times over the years. Good food, good service, good prices. I love their soup however, the beef soup is not on the menu but you can ask for it. The chicken soup is great too.

Jerk chicken wrap is delicious, crispy fries and a good price. Oxtail stew with rice and beans is a must, surprisingly good American breakfast.

I love to cook, and I have finally found a place that can stand in for when I want a home-cooked meal away from home.   I enjoy the tender saucy jerked chicken-its not a dry barbecue but that allows for succulent white meat. Hubby really liked their jerk chicken wrap. Im also glad I tried their homemade chicken tenders. Not greasy and with a crunchy batter. I wish I ate fish and shrimp, since they have several choices on the menu. They dont make food too spicy hot. If you want peppery food, bear that in mind.   My favorite sides are potato salad (not on the menu, so they need a half-hour in advance--its the best!!), curried spinach, curried cabbage and their fresh garden salad. They are carefully made, not slapdash afterthoughts.   I also like their sorrel and ginger-pineapple drinks. Plenty of flavor and not too sweet! Another treat not to be missed is the lemon meringue cake and special cakes like German chocolate. Homemade and fresh. Mmmm.   Give them a try. If you know what you want, call it in to avoid the wait for a custom order. They make great food well with a smile.

Chef is the best! His food is amazing! Just go! He catered my wedding, hes great people! The food speaks for itself.

This is by far THE BEST Jamaican food Ive ever had!!!!! Its as if they cooked it fresh as soon as I ordered it. The staff was friendly, the chef was friendly and great vibes were felt as soon as I got into the restaurant. Recommend this place to ANYONE and EVERYONE. Great authentic Jamaican food!

I dont know what happened but this was not that great. ??The counter worker was really nice though. ??However, when we got our food it looked a ??lot different than the picture. ??1st we didnt get any plates just styrofoam takout. ??And the portions of meat were smaller. ??For instance the curry goat and oxtails were mostly in the smaller part of the container. ??Taste wise I thought it could have been better

Like people say this place is a hidden gem. The food is great!!! Staff is attentive Location is hidden sometimes this is a good thing just to get away from big crowds  When you sit and sip on their ginger pineapple juice, you feel like you are in the Caribbean  The staff were great very attentive  They even had us try out their soup( it was delicious!)  I ordered the curry chicken, stew chicken with plantains and rice and peas with a beef patty My son had their Mac and cheese ( he even said he loves this place... Youd expect that coming from a 3 yr old at a chucke cheese) my girl had the ox tail, chicken stew, cabbage and rice and peas. As long as she loves the food Im happy Were expecting baby #2 and lately the cravings have been island foods Unforgettable flavors hit the spot.  The food was so good we even spoke with the chef about getting our next even catered.  Chocolate cake was also good  Go check this place out.

My husband and I have eaten at the restaurant a couple times and loved the food so much that we decided to have our dinner gathering catered by Chef Neville. ??We ordered our favorites: jerk chicken, shrimp curry, vegetable curry, rasta pasta, with rice and beans and plantains. ??The chef also brought us a fabulous spicy sauce. ??Every dish was perfect. ??The jerk chicken was tender and very flavorful. ??The shrimp in the shrimp curry was plentiful and cooked perfectly. The shrimp was tender and not over cooked. ??The rasta pasta had a nice spicy kick to it as did the vegetable curry. ??Chef Neville delivered the food on time and was always in touch with us. ??Everyone has always been very friendly and courteous. ??Our guests and even my parents loved the food!

Had the jerk chicken which was authentic, BUT I was not happy with the 1 hour wait at 8pm on Saturday night. The server said 30 minutes or less, but the food arrived at 9:15. Ugh I hate eating so late!! I decided to stop here after a trip to ikea based on 5 stars in yelp (you dont often see that). But my bf and I wouldnt return just bc of the really slow service and they dont offer us anything to eat until then?? Btw the curried spinach tasted good. The plantains taste exactly like how I bake them myself (not greasy at all).

This company robbed my company. They got free product and lied about non delivery. Shady ??business, definitely avoid!

My wife and I decided to try a different place today. ??I came across Unforgettable Flavors on Yelp and I noticed all the good reviews. ??This place is every bit of a 5 star spot. ??The chef Neville was there in the lobby and he greeted us with great hospitality. ??The food was great and the customer service was the best! ??They have life long customers now. ??Yall need to check them out!

OH MY!!!! Unforgettable Flavors is just that!!! The staff is VERY KIND AND PROFESSIONAL!!! The chicken beans soups is SOOO delicious!! The restaurant is very welcoming and pleasantly clean!! Thee BEST GOURMET CARIBBEAN FOOD IN THE DMV!!!

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR (and a flavor :p) AND GO HERE!!! The chef, Neville (began his career in a family restaurant in Jamaica) is so nice and only wants to share his Jamaican culture and incredible food with the world. Oh yeah... the food was unlike anything Ive ever been able to find in the D.C..... heck... even Maryland area and the atmosphere was homey, with reggae (island) music playing and beautiful Jamaican pictures which the Chef described to us, showing his love and care for his culture. I can go on and on about this place but let me keep it simple.  - Jerk Salmon w/ 2 sides (I loved the rice and beans, and mac and cheese) + Curry Shrimp w/ 2 sides + TWO slices of incredible..... INCREDIBLE lemon meringue pie (close to a cheesecake, but lighter and tastier) = $35 + tip. Perfectly filling.  - Support a wonderful business that brings you happiness and fills your stomach with amazing food. Also, if hes not too busy, strike up a conversation with Chef Neville. Hes a very nice guy to talk to!  - They gladly stayed open late for my girlfriend and I!  - I will be back frequently!.. Heck I looked into the apartment complex to se if I can move there and eat nothing but this place!! (no joke... but the apartments sadly dont fit the bill) : /  Do note that the restaurant is hidden on the bottom floor of a complex deep within the Seven Springs apartments... If you find the rec center and the fountain in the lake thing, the building is the one to the right. You will have to go down a small flight of stairs. Chef Neville tells me that he wanted to put up a sign to advertise the restaurant, but the apartments didnt want to for reasons of attracting too many outside customers, perhaps for parking reasons.... but Yelp has helped this issue! :)

Take the time to call them when you get here. Since it is in the 9348 building you will need to look for the Market Place awning to the left of the main entrance.  The food is amazing. Curry goat is delicious and tender. The jerk Tilapia was very flavorful.

The food here is really good! Weve eating here a few times and have NEVER been disappointed! I always order the oxtails, I love oxtails and Ive found very few places that serve them and if they do serve them, theyre just all wrong. I love the oxtails here and they arent stingy with them. The rice and peas, the jerk chicken, the Mac and cheese, the spinach, its all super flavorful. The chef/ owner is always smiling and he cooks his food with love!  Service is great, we always order to go and are always encouraged to stay and eat. Next time we will dine in. There is still so much on the menu to try, most definitely my go to for Caribbean food! Love this place!

First of all, the service is great. They always greet you when you walk in, and we were given complimentary soup samples when we had to wait for an order.   The jerk salmon is the best Ive ever had outside of Jamaica. My God, I could stop there. Ive been fiendin for it now that theyre temporarily closed. The Rice and peas have a little more spice than other Jamaican spots in the area, which I really like. I wasnt a big fan of the curry cabbage, but the salad is really good. Jerk chicken was good too. Curry chicken had a thin gravy (I prefer a thick gravy, just my preference) so I didnt order it again. I get the feeling that jerk is their specialty; I would go for that alone.   In summary, the jerk salmon changed my life. Come back to me, unforgettable flavors!

Extremely disappointed with our experience here. We were greeted by a line of people being serviced by a single cashier, who was clearly overburdened by having to bus tables, deliver food from the kitchen, and man the register and told is as much when we got to the front of the line. ??After waiting a full half hour to place our order and venting our frustration with a fellow yelper who was also on their first visit and equally shocked about the wait time, we sat and waited. In the next hour that we stayed, precisely 3 people got their food in the dining room. Meanwhile, 2 different delivery drivers were loaded up with food. This felt like a slap to the face to those of us who waited in line. It was at this point that we asked for a refund and left. The cashier didnt even bother to attempt to get us to stay or reason with us. What I got from that was that this isnt the first time that hes had to do that, but who knows.  I would never recommend this place to a friend, acquaintance, or someone I cared about. Im upset with myself for having believed the yelp hype, but I saw no indication that this would happen so Im leaving this review as a warning. An hour and half after entering this place, we were still 2 orders away from getting our food at a kitchen moving at a 20 min/entree clip. This place is not even close to worth the 5 stars its gotten from everyone, and I now wonder about Yelps legitimacy based on my experience.

Who knew there was awesome Caribbean-inspired food inside the Seven Springs apartment complex? ??This is truly a hidden treasure that I wouldnt have discovered if they werent listed on GrubHub. ??  We started with the West Indian patty filed with spinach and potato, which was a great combo of textures and flavors. ??The dough was tender but very flaky, and the filling was pretty smooth and very nicely spiced. ??Id love to try the meat patties next time (there will definitely be a next time!). ??The coconut fish was my favorite dish of the meal - generally, you cant go wrong with coconut cream, and this was no exception. ??The tilapia was nicely cooked and there was plenty of rich, delicious sauce covering the fish and the veggies. ??I had it served on red beans and rice, which would be a bit plain if served alone but actually complemented the coconut fish nicely. ??I also got the curried spinach side, which was a bit watery but very flavorful. ??  My dining partner enjoyed the Indian curry stew, which was not quite your typical Indian flavors but more of a hybrid with some Caribbean spices. ??It was full of veggies and little cubes of paneer (Indian-style cheese). ??It was definitely spicy! ??It was served with plenty of white rice, and not with other sides as indicated on GrubHub. ??  We wanted to try the bread pudding for dessert, but it was apparently full of rum - they warned us, and we decided to try the lemon cake instead. ??It was a yellow pound cake full of lemon pudding, topped with shreds of white chocolate. ??Totally surprising and very enjoyable! ??  This place can be a little confusing to find, but the buildings are all numbered and theyll give you directions if you call. ??Order ahead online, and they were incredibly friendly when we picked it up!

Was visiting from TX and found this place on yelp. The food is great and the staff is very nice. The best bread pudding I ever had! Definitely coming again during my next visit.

Yes...I finally found some BANGIN Jamaican food in PG County!   I use to live in the apartment complex they are located in so, I have no problems finding this place. But back to the food lol...  It is GOOD. Jerk wings and their OXTAILS, oh my! Their jerk chicken soup is awesome too (I had a free sample when I came in)!  The chef there is so friendly! I told him I would refer my coworkers there. The next day, they placed an delivery order (sorry to the staff there at Unforgettable Flavors LOL). But, the delivery went well and though they forgot one item, UF sent someone right back out to deliver it. The chef remembered me when my staff called and even said thanks for the referral!  I cant say enough wonderful things about this place. Awesome small business to support!

Hidden gem with delicious food along with courteous and attentive staff. I came in initially for the snapper, but after speaking with the chef, he persuaded me to get the oxtail, rice and beans, curry spinach and curry cabbage (I couldnt decide on one veggie). The chef also offered me a tiny cup of bean and chicken soup while my food was being prepared and that was GOOOOOD! I also noticed that they had a pineapple ginger drink and was offered a taste of that and that was GOOOOOD! ??I ended up getting a cup of the pineapple ginger and headed home. But before I left, I promised the chef that I would be back with a friend if the food was delicious.   The ox tail was GOOOOOD and it definitely didnt disapooint. It was tender, flalvorful with bone sucking deliciousness!!! I washed it down with my pineapple ginger. I wasnt too impressed by the curry spinach but the curry cabbage hit the spot.   Four days later, I returned with a friend. This time I got curry goat and that was GOOOOOD. Just like the oxtail, it was tender and flavorful. My friend got the oxtail at my recommendation and she definitely wasnt disappointed.   Before leaving, I called the chef over. He smiled and said Youre back? and I smiled back and said I keep my promises.

Took the family of 5 out for dinner. Was excited after reading some of the reviews... Sad to say this place didnt measure up. The ladies operating the place were pleasant enough. Although there were only 2 other families in the dining area it took awhile to have our orders taken. Turns out the chef was out on a catering job so menu selections were limited, but we had enough to choose from so we stayed. ??We ordered a variety of dishes with the plan to share. These plates werent cheap. It took over an hour to get our dishes on the table. Didnt understand why since there was no actual cooking being done (the chef was out). From what our server told us, they were just reheating and plating what the chef had already prepared. Although the taste of the curry shrimp, curry chicken, jerk wings, stewed chicken and oxtails were good (not great) there was hardly anything on the plate! For the price we expected more. I figured they were rationing off the leftovers to accommodate other customers, they still had a couple of hours before closing. I will say that the plates looked appetizing! We were not impressed enough to return. Oh and we were charged full price, I might have felt better if we were offered a discount on the measly offerings or at least a complimentary dessert.

My boyfriend and I stumbled on to this place after deciding not to IKEAs restaurant. Honestly, deciding to forego mass produced meatballs to eat at this establishment instead is safely one of the best choices Ive ever made.   The food is absolutely amazing and the service is so friendly and engaging. I felt comfortable, welcomed and appreciated by the staff.  All the food is fresh and made to order and the prices blow me away. I literally had one of the best meals of my life for under $10.   I cant wait to come back.

okay, its a trip to find this hidden gem of a restaurant in the dark (its in a basement of an apartment building at the back of the lot to the Seven Springs apartment complex and not in a well-lighted area!) but like others say, its worth the hunt. ??We had delicious food one Saturday evening about 7pm (curried spinach, curry coconut shrimp, plantains, jerk chicken rolls and Jamaican sodas) with friendly service. Unfortunately, they were out of Jamaican fruit cake and Jamaican bread pudding so settled for chocolate and a lemon cake instead. ??All the food was delicious including the mini cups of 16-bean soup they gave us while we waited for our meal to be put together. They played Bob Marley and Rita Marley music and songs the whole time we were there and theres some photos of Jamaica about the place. ??Well be back, if we can find it again! And its wheelchair accessible (no restrooms we could see, tho) but the ramp entrance to the doorway is up at the top of the hill in the parking lot!

Phenomenal food and great service tucked away in an apartment complex. ??We found this place through Yelp after a day at IKEA, and were just blown away.  The chef comes out and talks to all the customers, theyll walk you through the menu, and the food is just so phenomenally full of flavor, UMH! ??Please do yourself a favor and order the jerk chicken or stews, something with ALL of the goodness. ??There is no alcohol, but they have great smoothies and sides.   My only complaint is that the plantains are a tad dry, but overall we will keep coming back again and again!

Okay, so I am not from this area, but had to come down here this weekend. I looked for a really good Jamaican place because there are 0 in Frederick MD. Well, This place is fantastic. The food is absurdly good as we got the Jerk Chicken and Curry Goat, but the service is even better and amazing. I got lost getting there (and in a minute I am going to leave how to find it) so the guy gave me a discount. Then he let me try this homemade juice they have that is from fresh pineapples and ginger, OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!  When you go there your GPS will take you to the seven springs apartments. That IS where they are. There is a market there, and that is where their restaurant is. So when you pull in where your GPS tells you to you will see a big building on the right that has address 9348 on it. They are NOT in that building, but right past that building you will see a sign that says seven springs marketplace, and that is where they are! Might even be connected to the big building, but it you have to go past the big building to see it.   Amazing food, seriously, and amazing service. You will notice this is my first review, that is how compelled I found it to write.  Curry goat and curry cabbage are amazing!

Great Reggae music, island decor, friendly genuine people, top notch service and most importantly yummy authentic Jamaican Cuisine. So glad we came and will definitely be back as regulars! We ordered the beef patty, chicken patty, jerk chicken, braised oxtail, curry spinach, steamed veggies, rice and beans and Mac and cheese, all was delicious. They even served us a tiny cup of soup as gratitude gift welcoming us and thanking us for being their guests. My Jamaican approves 2 thumbs up and 5 stars! #islandlove #supportlocalbusinesses #lovemiyawdiepeopledem

Very friendly. They greet you as soon as you walk in. We both ordered the oxtails. The flavor was good but they really didnt give enough since theyre so boney. :-( ??I had the Mac and Cheese but it was gummy (I think the noodles were overcooked) and the cabbage is curry, I think I like traditional Jamaican with onions and carrots. ??  Will I go again?Yes-but I think Ill try a different dish.

First time visit and everything about this place is amazing! From the cozy interior that makes you feel like youre in a foreign country, to the best customer service from the chef to the server (chef came and greet us), and last but not the least the food. It was the *two thumbs up* kinds of food. Jerk and the curry chicken is delish! And the fish.. it was amazing! Also the coco bread and the pattie is one that I still arent able to get over because it lingers there, ??the taste is one that arent easily forgotten. Will definitely go back there! Also at the end the chef gave us a complementary cake, not sure of the name but it has a lemon flavor and it was the tase that could be found at a nice dessert place. Im going back there and would highly recommend this place for anyone to try it out!

Ive eaten food from here a few times over the past year. Personally, I think its overrated. The restaurant is small, in the basement of an apartment complex. Decor is island-themed, playing Bob Marley 24/7, but very low budget. Plastic tablecloths... Basically no ambiance for a sit down meal. Really a takeaway joint.  The food is decent. I usually get jerk chicken. Lately its been dry. Its not spicy at all, which is pretty sad, and it doesnt have that smoky flavor like real jerk. However, the portions are generous. Their side dishes are tasty, the veggies arent over cooked which is nice.   Really, its 3.5 stars. Rounding down for decor and inconsistent quality.

A tip to out-of-towners like myself:  This place is in an apartment complex, so dont scream at your GPS like I did for misleading you! Just remember the number of the building and enter the bottom of the building, and you will find it.   I had the Rasta Pasta with chicken and shrimp and enjoyed it very much. The jerk flavor was mildly spicy, not as intense (hot) as its been served to me by other places in the past. The chicken and shrimp were moist and succulent indeed. ??  I came on what they said was their busiest night in recent memory, and they were exhausted (I grabbed pick up right at closing) but they were still spirited and friendly. ??It was a Saturday night and the day after Bob Marleys birthday, so that may explain the madness. ??  BIG cavait - I have now ordered twice and had to wait and wait and wait when I arrived for a pickup order and then for a delivery (that took well over an hour) - both Saturday night, when I was told it would be 30 minutes, so just a heads up, at least on Saturday nights.

Seriously. Hard. To. Find. That apartment complex your GPS is telling you to turn in to? Yeah, do it. Then keep your eyes peeled.   Its totally worth it. The ginger pineapple drink is a delicious way to start your meal. The jerk *whatever* is yummy, and theyll make it as spicy--or mild--as you like. (Ive had the tilapia, a friend has enjoyed the chicken.) The curry spinach side is also delectable, and the goat curry is a hard-to-find treat.   Totally reasonable prices and friendly, effusive service. Okay, yes, the atmosphere is a little bland (see aforementioned apartment complex) but whatever. You want scenery? Go to the actual Caribbean. Otherwise, close your eyes, pretend youre on the beach, ??and enjoy Unforgettable Flavors!

Unforgettable is exactly what it was!!! Ordered the stewed &amp; jerk chicken combo with curry cabbage and rice and peas. The flavors were amazing and chicken was moist and tender and sides were cooked to perfection.   We met Chef Neiville and the rest of the staff and they were very engaged and charming, we felt welcomed and comfortable.   We love the intimacy of the place and cant wait to get back to try the Rasta Pasta.

The food is so delicious, the only pitfall is the waiting time (~40min) when dining in. I especially enjoy the coconut fish and shrimp pasta. It is so popular that the large amount of delivery impact its waiting time... In all, its a delicious restaurant.

We found this place by chance, actually. We saw good reviews on Yelp and hadnt seen a Caribbean restaurant before so we decided to check it out. It is in one of the most unlikely places youll ever find, but once we stepped through the door it was like finding what one of the staff called it, a hidden gem.   The people there are incredibly friendly and you can tell they take pride in their business. And that pride goes right into the food. It is one of the most delicious dinners I have ever had. We have immediately become life long customers of this place and cant wait to come back again.

A very enjoyable meal. Tasty Jamaican dishes (good size potions) for under $15 each... Heres what you should know.  1) its in an apartment complex. Follow the signs and its easy to find.  2) its no longer a full service restaurant, instead its a take out place with basic seating. Food served in styrofoam boxes even if you eat in the cafe. So if youre looking for white tablecloth experience youll be disappointed.  3) The food is really good. Jerk chicken, curried cabbage and spinach were all delicious. The only let down was the patty which was served from a heated display box. It was a bit limp and not as hot as it could have been.  4) Service is pleasant and friendly, but its not fast. ??We waited a while but chef Neville came out with some samples of his 16 bean soup (which I will buy next time, it was lovely) as a little thank you for all the customers.   The whole place makes you feel very welcome and we immediately felt comfortable. Its a little far from our home to become a regular choice, but ??I ??would definitely go back again. Its a little quirky, but in a way we liked. If youre in the mood for good food at a fair price give it a try.

First, I have to say the staff was very nice and friendly. The food was average. Ive had better more traditional Caribbean/Jamaican food. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and peas and curried spinach. The chicken was very good and really tender; however the flavor/spice didnt seem to go throughout the chicken, it just seemed to be on the surface. The rice and peas (beans) were different than the traditional way Ive always had them (brown and spicy instead of white and a lighter flavor) and I didnt care for the dish very much. I never had curried spinach before and it was a nice surprise but it didnt go well with the jerk chicken and spicy rice and peas. If I was to go back I would try something different but I would give them another chance.

Wow, who knew a small restaurant in a apartment complex could be this good. The service was excellent and it has a small mom and pops feel. Authentic and great tasting food. They have coco bread and patties which i havent had in a while too. Overall an excellent place to eat. Recommend for sure.

Wow Chef Neville is awesome! That Rasta Pasta was yummy. The vegetarian dishes are also very good. Its a down home place that makes you want to come back for more!

As a bonafide Jamaican who grew up eating Jamaican cuisine every day, I can attest that the food at UF is indeed authentic Jamaican fare. However, there wasnt anything extra special about the flavoring or the way the food is prepared to make it a stand-out or a recommendation. ??  Lets begin with the location &amp; d??cor. As many other Yelpers have mentioned, the location is very nondescript. Its situated inside the lower level of an apartment building and although theres a small sign, you will miss it unless you park and walk. The current picture of the owner wearing a chefs hat is misleading. The space is in no way representative of a high-end meal being prepared in a 5-star establishment. Maybe the picture was taken at another restaurant where he worked but at UF what youll actually experience is a walk up counter, maybe 4 diner-style pleather upholstered seats and a few tables. The food is only served in to-go Styrofoam containers and its plasticware for your utensils and cups. ??  We went on a Saturday afternoon. The service was decent. The young lad at the counter greeted us, answered most of our questions politely and patiently and tried very hard to ensure good customer service. ??At UF you order your food, then wait for it to be brought out to you if youre eating in, which we did. The wait time for our food was entirely too long -- at least 20 minutes -- which is something thats very prevalent in most Jamaican restaurants. I will never understand this. The foods already prepared. ??Whats the holdup???   Now on to the food itself. ??My companion and I shared plates and he ordered the rum cake, jerk chicken with rice and peas and curried cabbage. ??I ordered the oxtail and curry goat combo with rice and peas and plantains. ??We both ordered a mango smoothie. ??  The jerk chicken was decent and prepared in authentic fashion but lacked any real flavor or jerk seasoning. The rice and peas was dry and bland. Hated it. The oxtail was decent. The curry goat was decent. The curry cabbage was ok but its not something Id ever had before because Jamaicans dont usually make this. Plain cabbage, if cooked well enough, is good enough. The rum cake was ok but it was gummy. The plantains were ok. The mango smoothie was delicious! It was the best part of the meal. The portions were very small for the price. Its almost like they counted out the pieces to ensure you didnt get more than five oxtail and curry goat. I also had the displeasure of tasting what I think was intended to be either spinach or callalloo. ??This was brought out when they got my order wrong. ??But after sending it back twice and getting it back twice I just kept it and tried it. It was cold and gross. Yuck!  Overall, I was extremely disappointed that I relied on the Yelpers opinion which is usually on point. This was a fail and even if I was in the neighborhood and was dying for some Jamaican food I wouldnt go back. The food at Unforgettable Flavors was quite Forgettable and I have no idea why this place has so many 5-star ratings.

The jerk chicken is amazing! Takes me right back to my time in Negril. The place is small and a little hard to find but well worth it. Prices are good and the service is very friendly. The chef is awesome and he came out and talked to me for a while. This is a shinning example of local business, go get some!

The food is soooo good. I wish I knew about this place earlier. The place is in the middle of apartment complex and nobody would be able to find it until someone let you know about the place.

I loved this place. Before the little break they took, I went here several times and enjoyed the jerk chicken, curry chicken and even the brown stew chicken. I always got the white rice with curry cabbage-delicious!  However, this is my first time eating there since the break and I was not as impressed as I usually am. I got my typical jerk chicken with my usual sides and everything was mediocre in comparison to what Ive always had from there. The chicken wasnt dry, but it didnt have as much flavor. The rice was fine but the cabbage was also missing flavor.   I still like this place and am willing to concede that I may have caught them on an off day-but I have to be honest. Consistency is important to me---especially for staple dishes like jerk chicken.   On a better note-they have always had very good customer service....I mean excellent.

What a great discovery! ??Called in a pickup order, was cautious on what I ordered since Id never been there before. ??The cashier greeted me right away and the Executive Chef came out and greeted me also. I started asking about other Caribbean dishes I didnt see offered and Chef Neville indicated that if I called ahead, he would make it up! ??Then, much to my surprise, he served me a sampler of his two soups (both were amazing), a piece of jerk chicken (to die for!), and, my favorite ... goat curry (which was off the chart!), accompanied by his homemade pineapple-ginger juice. ??The vibes there are so positive and the food is even better! ??I let them know that Id be bringing back all of my work colleagues for sure! ??I shared my chicken patty as soon as I got back to work and we both really liked it and she shared with another colleague who really liked it also! ??We will definitely be going as a group next time!!! :)

Was there for lunch on the way back to NY from DC. Dont judge a book by its cover. Really 4 1/2 stars. A hidden gem in an apartment complex. The chef comes out to personally greet customers.  Complimentary sorrel which is unusual and delicious.  Had the jerk fish wrap. Excellent. Bob and Ziggy Marley playing in the background. Who could ask for more!!!

Went here on the recommendation of other reviews and really enjoyed everything. The nicest young man greeted us and went over the entire menu with us. We started w the chicken patty which was spicy and good. They brought complimentary of oxtail soup We had brown stew and jerk chicken w spinach, plantains, beans and rice and the most delicious curry cabbage. And topped it off w lemon meringue cake which was light and refreshing. So much so that we ordered another to go. Loved all that we ate and the warm hospitality of the staff. It is set up as take out with a few booths and wait service. I highly recommend this spot!

Been coming here almost 2 years and never had any complaints. ??This food makes me want to hop a flight to Jamaica Mon! #everytingcurry

Tried their red snapper and it was cooked well, meat was slightly tough but could be due to the time of the year.   Next time, I tried the jerk wrap and fries. Very very good but if you take it to go, ask them to make it less saucy or no condiments (or separate). Sucks having a soggy wrap when you take it out the container.   Their pineapple ginger drink is really good, it has some kick to it from the real ginger.

This restaurant stunning, the stuff here so generous, polite, friendly they are let us taste new things like ginger soup so good. I will absolutely come back here. This restaurant really  unforgettable flavor .

OMG!! This place is such a gem! Came here thx to the great reviews on Yelp. This place definitely deserves 5 stars! The service was impeccable- better than some of the fine dining establishments weve been to! The chef came out to greet us and explained the menu. We ordered the West Indian chicken &amp; beef patties as appetizers. I got the chicken &amp; shrimp rasta pasta my hubby got the combo jerk chicken &amp; oz tail with rice &amp; beans and steamed veggies. We split a ginger soda. All of it was DELICIOUS!! The flavors were definitely unforgettable- hence the name of the restauarant. This place is on our list of favorites now. Trust me. You will not be disappointed!

Hidden in an apartment complex, but dont let that fool you about quality or deliciousness! The staff is friendly, kind, and willing to explain any dishes or answer any questions. The vibe is really chill, with Jamaican music playing and nice pictures up on the wall. They have daily specials.   I tried the ??coconut curry chicken, fried plantains, and curry spinach, as well as pineapple ginger drink and lemon meringue. The front-desk asked, Is it really your first time? This sounds like what a regular would order. Needless to say, the whole meal was awesome, especially the fried plantains and spinach. The Pineapple ginger drink was sweet and quite intense, but I still recommend trying any of the homemade drinks they have. Food came out in a short amount of time, no more than 10 minutes, and it was all fresh.

We took my father here for his birthday. The staff were very attentive and we were treated like family, even though it was late. The FOOD was exceptional. The flavors were balanced and complementary. From the Sorrel drink to the curry shrimp and meringue cake - it all came together. Everyone at our table, enjoyed every bite. ??  The restaurant hard to find, in an apartment complex, at the bottom of one of the buildings - but its worth the effort to get there.   Did I mention the prices are unbeatable for this level of cooking? Thank you Chef!!

We decided to check this place out after finding it on Zomato. Its a little hard to find. By that I mean its in the basement of an apartment complex that appears to be gated, and it doesnt have a sign. We found it literally by stalking the catering van. Hint: its across from the pool. This place is well worth the trouble it takes to find it. Amazing. The Jerk Rasta Pasta is probably the best thing Ive ever had. Our greeter / server went far beyond the typical service. Hes pretty neat stuff. We will most definitely be coming back here. I highly recommend the cucumber cooler and the plantains! Good stuff.

Must Visit. The food was so good. The first thing that stood out was the temperature. The food came out hot and full of flavor. The curry goat was soooooooooo tender and the curry was so seasoned and I do not even like curry. I loved the jerk chicken as well but the highlight for me were the sides. First, I had the mac and cheese, I thought I was going to be disappointed because it didnt have the hard topping from being baked but low and behold it was so cheesy and creamy and the seasoning was so good. It definitely melted in my mouth. The curry cabbage was so juicy, the rice and peas was so good especially with the curry goat gravy. Lastly, the plantains were so soft, hot and a great taste, not sweet but perfectly cooked. I loved this restaurant, the staff was very welcoming and friendly and I will be back!

This place really is a hidden gem! For around $10 you can get a stack of jerk chicken and 2 sides (the plantains are delicious).

Perfection! The food was fabulous. Flavorful and adjusted for spices by request. Me, mild; my friend HOT! The server was friendly &amp; knowledgable. I had vegetarian stew. Large portion and so full of flavors. My friend had the combo. Both of us raved and we are pretty picky. Before the food came they brought us a little cup--a surprise off the menu 16 bean &amp; chicken soup/stew. It was like a drug dealer offering you a taste -- we will be sure to come back!  The chef came out to make sure our order was right and everything was good.   A little hard to find in the dark for the first time. Just turn into the apartment complex at the sign Marketplace. Go just past the gym building on the left and they are down the outside flight of steps on the right. Its well wort oh.

Food was pretty good :)  The cashier was super nice! I will eat there again!

Wow, this is a really nice restaurant located in the apartment complex (Building 9348 lower level). The Market entrance is on the lower level.  Really good food, good value, excellent service, and we enjoyed meeting the chef after we were finished eating.  It was a refreshing change from the fast food we get quite a bit of on vacations. It was all prepared from scratch, and was fresh. And the sample of Fish Soup was really worth just ordering more of (if we hadnt been full).  Worth checking out...

Sometimes its nice to be able to sit down ??and enjoy Jamaican food. Normally when eating carribean u just get your food in a styrofoam container and go. But if you if youre in the mood to eat sit down and see your food with a little presentation this is a nice little place. ??Ambiance not so much but who cares when your food is good!?! They are very friendly and everytime Ive gone they gave me a complimentary something to try. Free food? ??Im a fan

Today was my first visit to Unforgettable Flavors. Id like to start my review by saying the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. The man I presume to be the manager was very good about answering my questions about their menu and I was even able to sample the cabbage before I made my decision on what to order. The food is great. The macaroni and cheese is amazing and so are the chicken tenders, which happen to be homemade. The curry chicken is also great...I just wish it had carrots! I will definitely return to unforgettable flavors soon.

I went to unforgettable flavor with high hopes. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and beans and plantains. The jerk chicken and rice were both very bland and lacked salt and spices. It was a shame that the plantains were the only things in the order with any sort of flavor.

It is amazing.  I never had Jamaica cuisine before and my friend recommended this restaurant located in seven spring. I really hate the seven spring apartment since its condition is so poor so I doubted about my friends choice at first.  But after trying the food in this restaurant, I have a new reason to come to seven spring again. I love the flavor and the kindness service. I will definitely come again.

The real deal. ??Homemade Jamaican food. ??Truely tasty and frssh made flavors. ??Love the unique location inside if an apartment complex. ??The wait was longer than expected.

First, I will say that the food really is amazing and I ate it for 3 of the past 4 meals! No joke.  I drive past the apartment complex where this place is located EVERYDAY and had no idea it existed until a few months ago. Finally giving in to my long unsatisfied craving for some good Caribbean food and wanting to continue to avoid Caribbean II and Dunns River with their sketchy food and service, I decided to take the plunge. Everybody on Yelp couldnt be wrong. I decided to go for delivery and ordered thru EatStreet. The order arrived about 1 1/2 hrs after it was placed (seriously). About 30 minutes in, the restaurant called to verify that Id paid (duh), and hung up before I could ask when to expect delivery. I called back 30 min later and was told someone was just leaving with the order. When he arrived the order was a bit mixed up, but he was so courteous and apologetic (We had a pretty big order). ??He actually went back to the restaurant, they called, we sort of got things squared away, and he RETURNED TO OUR HOUSE with the missing or wrong items. ??I was impressed. These folks really know the meaning of SERVICE.  In the end, we had a great meal--beef and veggie patties, jerk chicken, oxtail, vegetarian stew, plantains, jerk tilapia, and ginger beer. My family was in a food coma.  Weve decided to go to the restaurant soon to check out that experience. Definitely a gem in the neighborhood!

One of the litmus tests of a Caribbean eatery is usually with the Patties. ??The first version I tried was made with beef. The cut-up pastries arrived on a bed of mixed leaf salad (nice chefy touch) looking similar yet different from the versions Ive had. ??The pastry was the orange-hued flaky dough, a tradition trait, but there was no pocket of air like others Ive seen. ??The filling was savory without the usual over-seasoning (others), and there was a mild chili burn that crept up after a few bites. ??What I enjoyed about these bites was the home-made quality and the balanced seasoning that did not make them too beefy. ??A spinach version was ordered on another occasion. ??The pale flaky crust (traditional look) held a smooth filling exuding a mild vegetable flavor with bare bitterness, an intriguing Indian-inspired spice note, and a level of savoriness that brought a level of satisfaction and fascination with each bite - I just could not get enough of it. ??The side sweet sauce was unnecessary when we already have a wonderfully made vegetable pastry like this version here. ?? The patties here standout in a subtle way with their well-balanced flavors and seasoning, as well as their in-house made appearance, which make them worthy meal-openers.   To read rest of review and view photos, check out my blog at Wongeats.

You know when you eat and youre full, well Im still eating cause its that good. Even the owner came out to talk to us.

All of the other reviews are on point, about friendly, attentive service, and well developed flavors in traditional Jamaican menu. ??My 11 yr old son ate three servings of jerk chicken (never done this before) and devoured the beef pattie (not greasy at all). ??Curry cabbage, recommended by the Washington Post review, was delicious as well as the rice and beans. ??The jerk chicken, curry chicken, and curry shrimp had the right heat ( you can request more or less to your liking). ??This will definitely be our new Jamaican spot...now that we found the place!

I was in the area today and hungry so I figured Id try one more time. I walked into the noticeably clean establishment and was energetically greeted by a professional young gentleman behind the counter who took my order. The gentleman was very efficient, he immediately provided my Pattie while he prepared my pineapple ginger punch and the chef prepared my Jerk chicken entree/curry cabbage/rice n peas . The good was excellent, glad I gave it a second chance, way to bounce back and keep up pleasant customer service. I shy wait to visit a few more times and try more dishes so I can return and rate 5 stars.

Amazing food. Wonderful flavors with a really great home cooked appeal. Weve ordered from them four times in the last couple of months, trying something new each time. We havent been disappointed yet.  To top it all off, their service has been incredible. Firstly, its really awesome to have a place that delivers thats not another pizza joint. Secondly, they understand the value of customer service. With our last order, the delivery person forgot our sides. We called the restaurant as soon as we found out, and ten minutes later the store owner was at our front door, sides in hand, to apologize and thank us for our business.

Perfect location for apartment residents, not so much for other visitors. Like... am I allowed to park here? Small set up with limited seating but enough. The staff was extremely nice and helpful in choosing from the menu. The chef came over and gave us a complimentary taste of a fish bisque which was delish, did I mention... I hate fish! He made me a believer. I got the jerk chicken which was cooked to perfection but I just didnt like that there were tiny pieces of bone through out, not sure if that is normal but bones arent very taste or nice to my teeth. The jerk was a little spicy for me doable for my non spicy palette. My boyfriend got the oxtail and loved it. Both the chicken and oxtail were extremely tender, how they do that?! The seamed vegetables were cooked perfectly and the plantains werent mushy and perfect... I used them to sop up the jerk sauce/seasonings.... woooo. Heaven?! Hello!  Again, another hidden gem that I hope stays that way. Great job!

Chef Nevilles wonderful flavors that are truly Unforgettable! ??We are so glad they cater as our clients are always wanting more and his chicken soup is AWESOME!

Really incredible good. Outstanding customer service from the chef. I will be a regular here.

There is good reason this restaurant has 5 stars - virtually unheard of on Yelp. ??We have never gone to the restaurant but have had delivery. We have had the chef/owner deliver to us - I appreciate an owner who will do what needs to be done to make things happen.  The food is absolutely delicious. What more is there to say? You will not be disappointed!

It was a bit hard to find at first but the staff is super friendly and even gave me extra goodies when I finally arrived. ??I had curry goat, cabbage, and plantains. ??Very good food and very good vibes from this place.

Oh ya mon. I get it...so much so I sat and booked to Montego Bay on Southwest as soon as I finished eating. Dont let the location fool you...the food is fantastic

Totally agree with everyones 5 star rating. The place is a little small but has a warm family atmosphere. ??As soon as we sat down we received a complimentary ??15 bean soup starter. Was very hearty and a must try. I have visited numerous carribean restaurants on the east coast and ??both the jerk chicken and ox tail are the best I have ever had. Meal came with two sides for 10 bucks each.

Ordered the jerk chicken. Pretty good. Though not a big fan of the sides (cabbage and spinach).

The food is phenomenal!!! I felt even more elated to find that they are trying a new delivery service. They are trying their best to accommodate everyone, as such.

Went here because i wanted to try something new and when I saw the yelp reviews I had to give this place a try!! Had Caribbean food before at bahama breeze and I wasnt wowed by it at all. so I was really excited to give this place a try. Was kinda skeptical at first because navigation took us to these apartment buildings. It turns out unforgettable flavors is located in the marketplace of the apartments. I will Never judge a restaurant by its cover again. Lea quickly sat us and brought us the menu. She found out that it was our first time here and gave us some awesome recommendations. Not only that but she gave us some house chicken soup for choosing unforgettable flavors !! How awesome is that!?! The soup was delicious! I tried the salmon rasta pasta and it was so freakinggg good! The sauce and spices were perfect! We also got the braised oxtail and we liked it. The oxtail was very soft and tender and went well with the rice. Overall this place is awesome And I cant wait to go back and try something new!

Small little place inside an apartment, almost got lost. Ordered the jerk chicken and it was amazing!

We went here after reading reviews from the Washington Post. This is a small restaurant inside a residential complex. The chef came out to greet us. I had the jerk chicken rasta pasta, which was ok. Dont go here for the pasta! We had also ordered the Curried Shrimp, the jerk tilapia and the veggie wriap. All of which were delicious. We also ordered the fresh ginger pineapple juice, which was fabulous. Dont get any of the bottled drinks. they need to move to a better location. You dont go here for the ambience or anything else. Just eat and leave!

Food: A+ Customer service: A+ Unforgettable Flavors lives up to its name and more!! After looking for some good Caribbean food for the last 6 months, I finally Yelped the area near my office behind UM. Unforgettable Flavors came up as top rated with no less than 4 stars. As a South Floridian, I grew up eating all kinds of food from many different countries/cultures so Im picky about places saying theyre authentic or gourmet. I was so impressed by this place I had to submit a review. When I walked in I was greeted by both the chef and wait staff. They were super friendly!To top this experience off and cement a perfect first impression, the chef asked me how I liked my plantains and actually let me see the one hed picked to cook ON THE ??SPOT! I had the braised oxtail (tender and super flavorful), rice &amp; beans, and plantains. Everything was excellent! ??This place is a WINNER!! I will be back!

I had the oxtail. It was ok. Food could use alot more flavor. Nice service. Clean place.

Good Jamaican food and the presentation and service is awesome . Will definitely visit again . Oh and the fresh juices are really good too

Wow!! I need to take my previous review back! Went here today on a whim and theh definitely redeemed themselves. ??The brown stew chicken was out of this world!!!!!! So so amazing!!

Yummy food and great hospitality! ??We all had different things recommended by chef Neville and everything was delicious: jerk chicken, coconut curry chicken, braised oxtail with great sides: curried cabbage, curried spinach, mac and cheese. He also sent out a sampler of bread pudding which we immediately ordered a full portion of to share. To find it go down the outdoor steps to the left of the entrance to 9348.

it is a small place but have unbeatable flavor! near my workplace and ideal for a lunch break!

Compare to other food I have ordered else where, the food actually looks like it was made carefully. The chicken taste pretty good (Jerk Chicken Wrap) I recommend it. Tropical Smoothie is very sweet ,but in a good way because I can actually taste the real strawberries.  - The delivery guy forgot to get the smoothie &amp; soda I ordered, but I call them &amp; they apologized imminently and delivered again :) I like how polite when they answered the call and redelivered the drinks. The second deliver didnt try to take the tip saying that it is their fault. Ill order from them because they really know how to treat people with respect.

Hidden gem indeed! ??We drove by it twice as it is NOT in the usual area (apartment complex) and below street level, but OH BOY was it worth it! Yummy, TASTY food with awesomely nice owners that would come out and check on you all the time! ??Lots of samples too! ??Thumbs up!

Wow! ??I had Rasta Pasta with Jerk chicken. ??It was WAAYYY too good for a little restaurant tucked in the basement of an apartment complex. ??There is snow outside. ??When you walk in, the Caribbean music makes you feel like you are on the islands mon. ??Great place. ??Great food and great service.

Yesterday while visiting the Ikea in College Park I decided to try out this restaurant and did not regret my decision. I ordered the curry goat with rice and peas and a side of plantains. The portion size was perfect since I even had some leftover to share with my hubby who is Jamaican not a grain of rice was left. ??The restaurant was extremely clean and the service for a Caribbean restaurant was welcoming. What topped it off for me was that the waiter gave me a sample of their cheese cake after I overhead him telling another customer that it was a slice of heaven he was serving them. Little personal touches like this makes a business and I will definitely be going back.

Food is delicious. Very warm and friendly atmosphere. Their slogan is right on point a truly unforgettable experience. Great tasting!!!! Rasta Pasta / Tilapia delicious.

Seriously incredible food. Jerk chicken is the right amount of spice, delicious curried cabbage. The red velvet cake was amazing, too -- the best Ive ever had! Cake is moist (not a dry crumb!), cream cheese frosting is silky smooth (unlike other places, where the frosting is often grainy), flavors balanced. Havent been in person, but thats only because I live in DC and dont have a car... otherwise Id be dropping in all the time!

Ill start by saying that there is no place in the College Park area, or maybe anywhere, that I am happier giving my money to. ??I constantly feel like the food I receive is well worth the price I pay, and sometimes, worth more (especially given the area in which there is little of good eating value). ??But beyond that, the staff here is SOOO nice, I truly love supporting them whenever I can. ??  The food is pretty unique as I know of only one other jamaican place around (Jerk Pit) that isnt nearly as good. ??Plus, UF seems to have more of an indian twist to some dishes, which I like. Im so glad that theyre yelp fanbase has grown so much from when I started going.

Delicious jerk chicken. Seasoned perfectly with great spice and not too much salt as some jerk chicken can be. I love that the chicken is cooked bone in and skin on resulting in incredible favor. Ive also had the goat curry which is fall apart tender and delicious. The staff is so friendly too. Love this place.

Best Hole in the Wall find in College Park!! Like everyone says... the lower level of an apartment building of all places. The food is delicious. They have a bunch of Caribbean places like this in NY... and the food is definitely comparable! I say... stop by... and have some delicious Caribbean food! Dont expect anything extravagant... only good food and good service!

A hidden gem indeed! Met the owner at work one day and he was talking about his restaurant. So one day my coworkers and I placed an order for lunch. I had the shrimp roti which was delightful. Being that my mother is from the west indies I know what good roti is and the roti served at this spot was just perfect! Nice and soft. The shrimp was curried just right and a good amount of jumbo sized shrimp made it all that better:) I also had a spinach pattie which was awesome!!! Odd location but made it that much more special! Also very very clean cafe area and kitchen!!!! Definitely recommend this spot for some good Jamaican food!!!!!

Food was excellent! ! We waited a little longer than usual for our food, we had a bigger dinner party...but it was well worth the wait! Service was great, the chef even came out and greeted us. Try the jerk chicken, and shrimp rasta pasta...amazing! ! Will be returning!

Hmmmm. Not a good start. I had to keep calling for 30 minutes before I got an answer. I was then told they ran out if oxtails. New batch wouldnt be done in an hour. I asked to just place my delivery order and I understood I wouldnt get it for another two hours. I was told he couldnt do that and to call back AGAIN to place my order. Ok. So An hour later it took 40 minutes to get someone on the phone. He proceded to hang up when I mentioned delivery. 30 minutes later after calling non-stop same guy answered and asked me to hold on one minute. I could hear conversations , music, etc in the background. After ten minutes if me screaming HELLO!!! I decided to remain on hold and drive the 9 minutes to Unforgetable Flavors. I walk in and show my phone to the guy. Oooops. He apologizes and hangs up his phone. Id been on their phone for nearly 30 minutes!!! Aaaaand of course the oxtails are on hold. What does this mean sir? Theyre not ready and wont be for awhile. I order cowfoot stew. He tells me its cow &amp; cod. Im like cod as in fish? He said yes. I say Ill try something else. He says Im really missing out on something special. So I asked to try it. It was one of the best conconctions that has ever crossed my lips. The best. I got a small stew, $6, a side of mac&amp;cheese $3.50, stew chicken &amp; jerk chicken combo. The servings are EXTREMELY small. I was shocked at the large spoonfull of mac. And it was a little bland. All other items were delicious. At this point I have mixed feelings about this place. They need to get their phone skills and delivery business together. Oh----and if the customers change is $15.89 and you dont have pennies YOU take the loss and give the customer $15.90!! Do not try to give $15.85. That was my piss off #7 of my experience. Food was great. Decisions. Decisions. But Im sticking with one star until given a reason not to.

The food was great! I ordered theCoconut Fish and west indian beef pattie and the duns river smoothie. The coconut fish was excellent!!!! The pattie was fresh from the oven. The smoothie beautiful for a summer day! I was a bit confused of the location because its in an apartment complex. Luckily they gave me the directions. The place is very clean inside. I will definitely be going back again.

Great food, service and attitude. ??The chef/waiter/owner not sure what he is, but a really nice positive guy took our orders. ??The food was great, we had the Rasta Pasta, Jerk Chicken and OxTail. ??Everything was great except I felt the Oxtail could have been a larger quantity, but maybe just because the food was succulent. ??The chicken was moist and flavorful. ??The only downside, is the location seems a little sketchy, inside a condo/apartment, but just adds to the local experience. ??Overall, left the restaurant happy, satisfied, and feeling happy.

The best Jamaican food. EVER. Wonderful staff. Some great desserts to try, too. Way worth your money. I have never been disappointed whenever I had a meal there. The presentation is great too. It is one of those restaurants where you ALWAYS get a warm welcome and delicious food. Chef Nevilles passion for great cooking is well reflected in the food. I have promised my friends to take them there for the next dinner!!

Absolutely EXCELLENT!!! We were shopping near by, needed dinner, and used Yelp for suggestions. When this came up with 5 stars we decided to give it a try. The place is located in the lobby of an apartment complex, somewhat of an usual location. Dont let this full you, the service and food are absolutely delightful. My wife had the rasta pasta with jerk chicken and I tried the brown stew, jerk chicken combo. Both were just fantastic. The rum cake was just devine AND the prices are a bargain. By the way, their home-made ginger pineapple drink is a must. Cant wait yo go back and sample the rest of the menu.

I love this little restaurant. Its at the basement level of an apartment building off of Cherry Hill. The vibe is comfortable and casual. A Bob Marley album was playing on loop. We visited during lunch time. There was a steady stream of people dropping in to pick up their carry out orders. There were couple of other parties dining in as well. I am very fond of akee and saltfish. Alas, it was only available for in the breakfast menu. However, upon inquiring about it, they made it especially for me. It was quite good, but I would have liked more salt fish in it. My dining companion ordered the jerk chicken. It was perfect! It was perfectly seasoned. Perfectly done. Thoughts of it makes me salivate as I type. We received excellent service. They were very attentive without being bothersome. The only negative for me is that it is a little difficult to find, but now that I know where it is, I cant wait to go back.

That chicken wrap is one of the best meals Ive had. The chicken is cooked to perfection. First time here but will be back on a weekly basis since I work right down the street. Yaaaaaa monnnnnn

I just have the best experience of my life, their customer service definitely makes me want to come back. The food is well presented, well cooked and taste great. I enjoyed my whole snapper, the rice and peas was delicious. Nice place to enjoy some good food. I am coming back soon.

My husband and I came here the end of April. The location is a bit odd, due to the cafe being located in an apartment complex. Nonetheless, I actually dont mind, because its not a lot of traffic or groups of people hanging around. The cafe is small, casual, and quaint, not that appealing, but when the food and customer service is excellent I can care less. Anywho, my husband and I walked in to be greeted by a young handsome man, who I think was a sous-chef because he said he would be preparing our food. He chatted briefly with us and gave us complementary pineapple ginger and sorrel juice drinks in huge glasses and brought out hot coco bread. It was all delicious. The waiter (the only waiter/host) took our orders and even though he was new to this job, he answered all of our questions and was friendly. My husband ordered jerk chicken w/ vegetables and plantains. I ordered the combo brown stew chicken and oxtails with macaroni and curried spinach. Not only did the sous chef bring out our food and set it up, but it was presented very nicely and all the meats were moist and seasoned well. Its only been a few select times in life that Ive had chicken breast so tender and moist. The sides were good too. Ive thought about that macaroni EVERYDAY since I ate it. The vegetables and spinach was fresh and cooked well. The plantains were good, not overly ripe. In the midst of eating, the chef(older caribbean guy) walked into the cafe and greeted us and ask if everything was good.The customer service is on point, better than some high class restaurants Ive been to. I will definitely be back.

I used to work as a lifeguard at the pool at the complex during the summer during high school so it was crazy to be back. The place is in the market place below the building across from the leasing office. Hard to find. As soon as I walk in I was greeted by the manager/owner/chef. He was a very nice guy and welcomed me with open arms. He offered me an excellent suggestion with the jerk chicken and I got rice and beans and cabbage as a side. I got the order to go so while I waited everyone was super friendly and chatted with me about the place. Food turned out to be amazing, almost mind blowingly good. The other Caribbean options in the area pale in comparison to this place. Best jerk chicken Ive had. The quality of food and service this place offers really reinstilled my faith in the food industry in northern PG county, which generally sucks. Please patronize this place!!

Incredible delicious authentic food and service! Chef Neville is gracious and talented. Jerk was fantastic and the curry cabbage and spinach equally tasty. The sorrel was flavorful and not too sweet.

Best meal Ive ever had in the U.S. Its hidden in the seven spring apartment thats difficult to find. Price is cheap but food was fantastic. staff was also nice.

First time at UF today and had the jerk chicken wrap. ??It was unbelievably flavorful and moist. ??Loved it! ??The chef and his business partner both came out to say hello and welcome us. ??You dont see that level of service nowadays. ??All in all it was a five star experience. ??I think Ive found a new go to lunch spot.

This is a hidden treasure hidden inside the Seven Springs Apartment complex. Loved the staff and food! Chef Neville personally came out and greeted us. The staff was very friendly and welcoming! 2 of us had Jerk Chicken Rasta Pasta, 1 Shrimp Rasta Pasta, and 1 Jerk Chicken with a side of Rice and Curry Spinach. Each of our meals were excellent! Then they brought us a sample of ginger sorrel and pineapple ginger as well as fresh coconut water. It was a wonderful experience! We are from Phoenix and will be sure to come back and visit!

One of the best places around college park, maybe the best. Chef Neville, besides being a great chef is also a very warm person. Food is excellent. I like the decor. That, along with reggae music that plays in the background gives this place an inviting Caribbean feel.

Went on a casual friday afternoon and was wonderfully surprised by this gem of a restaurant. Delicious food, generous portions, and excellent service. Had the rasta pasta with jerk chicken = delicious. Also tried the lemon meringue cake = yummm. We will definitely be back to see Chef Neville!

So disappointed that they will be closed for a few months. ??Weve been there twice--once in a party of two and once in a party of four. ??Both times we experienced service with a smile and joy, and food prepared with skill and magic flavor skills. ??We tried the jerk chicken, curry vegetable stew, oxtail, curried fish, and the goat stew, along with curried spinach, curried cabbage, plantain, rice and beans, etc. ??Everything was deeply flavored and made with great ingredients. ??The portions were just right for a great meal--no overwhelming plates. ??Even the bread pudding was amazing. ??Cant wait till they open again! ??The room is in an odd place for a restaurant, and its a smallish room. ??You will wait while your meal is cooked to order. ??Get an appetizer or two and just enjoy each others company and talk until it comes. ??Once they put that plate in front of you, everyone will be heads down into it and smiling between bites.

Great customer service and delicious food! ??Enjoyed the curry chicken and jerk chicken. ??Very clean and pleasant, right below the high rise apts 9348. ??If you live in the complex or nearby, great place to stop by for a quick bite to eat. ??Their beef patty is amazing!

This was one of the worst experiences that weve had at a restaurant. We went on a Saturday night and because it was so busy, we decided to order carry out. The problem is the place was chaos and no one had any idea what was going on. Even though we arrived before some of the other people, we were made to wait to place our order. We waited patiently to order which was a huge mistake and cost us one and half hours. While we waited we were able to observe the inefficiency that goes on within the place. After each person working at the restaurant confirmed our order at least 4 times each, they still managed to screw it up. We ordered 2 side orders of Mac and cheese and 1.5 hours later, that wasnt even right. We got one ordered in a burned box that had maybe 10 noodles in it. They should be embarrassed if thats what they call a side order of food. We understood that they were busy and that wed have to wait for the food but we were quoted 40 minutes but more likely 30 minutes for our food. While they were apologetic and gave us a free slice of cake, the best tasting food in the world cant make up for such inefficiency and then not even giving us what we ordered. Dont waste your time going here. Id rather go to Mcdonalds and at least be able to enjoy my Saturday night....

This place is awesome! Its a nice little rival to the Jerk Pit restaurant down route 1. I was skeptical to try it at first, but its right at the bottom of my apartment building so today I went! I had the jerk chicken combo with rice and peas and curry cabbage. The jerk chicken was the right amount of spice with a little bit of sweet...absolutely finger licking good and moist! The curry cabbage was definitely a welcome change from the traditional cabbage mix and i would recommend it. The rice and peas were decent. My partner had the curry shrimp and white rice, and she said the curry sauce was really good. We both finished our plates and were extremely satisfied. Some may complain that the portion size is a little small but the price and taste is sooo good. Definitely worth it! The staff is really friendly and the food taste authentic and fresh. I will be going back here a lot more.

What can I say that hasnt already been said about Unforgettable Flavors?! This small cafe is truly hidden away in a complex of apartment buildings... it is definitely hard to find but definitely worth the trip. The cafe is small but cheery and immaculate. I believe that during our meal at the cafe each and every employee (about 4) came out to either check on us or say hello. This was not disengenuous but truly heartfelt. The Hostess/waitress Lea was extremely nice and helpful in choosing dishes. She also offered and brought us a taste of the fish soup (hubby loved...I dont eat fish) and the ginger/pineapple drink which was wonderful. We split a Meat patty which was spicy and delicious and I had the combo brown chicken/curry chicken with a side of rice and beans and plantains. My husband had the coconut tilapia with rice and beans and plantains. The curry chicken was delicious!! It is on the bone and very moist and tender in a delicate sauce. The brown stew chicken wasnt my favorite. The meat wasnt as tender and the sauce was underwhelming. But I did love mopping the curry sauce up in the beans and rice. The plantains were great! Not greasy at all but lightly sauteed with a very sweet and creamy center. My husband loved his coconut tilapia! We were too full for dessert but look forward to a return visit to this hidden gem! I should also say that the ladies room which is outside of the restaurant in the hall is old but also immaculate!

This place is really great. Authentic Caribbean Food everything was so fresh and not greasy. The cake was delicious to not to mention the fruit smoothie. ??The name is really befitting. It is well worth the try if you are in the College Park area. Great atmosphere, very clean and the staff was very courteous and pleasant. College Parks greatest little secret is out!!!

Excellent food. ??The food is freshly prepared for each order. ??Flavorful Carribean fare. ??The prices are affordable I would pay a lot more for the excellent dishes. ??This place is definitely worth checking out.
