Still the best crab cakes around!! ??This place has the atmosphere and culinary delights to appease many. Which it did for us! ??We had a group of 15 for an anniversary party and everything went smoothly, everyone had a good time and the food was fantastic!  We ordered stuffed mushroom caps with crab, potato skins, and onion rings for appetizers. The caps were good sized and stuffed full of crab. The skins were almost like half potatoes! ??The rings were thick and plentiful.  I ordered the crab cake dinner, it came with the soup and salad bar. Loved every bite!!! We took advantage of the early bird menu. It is a full menu with lower prices!

My husband and I love this place. BLAST FROM THE PAST!! we usually get the burger. The steak is good and prime rib is excellent. They have a flute player and specials for valentines day (last year February was our first time there). ??We go often for the burgers and steak!! Great staff and friendly service. Also has cozy feel and large fire place.  Although I wish they had better signage it looks closed. And when you google image the place it shows a closed location.

Really good French dip, make sure you get it with some raw horseradish! Stephanie our server was awesome knowledgeable and concise if you like your prime rib rear get there around 3/4pm

Alright, my Auntie is in town and she suggested that we meet here for a quick bite.   Located in CP on 193, in between the Staples and the Shell, no you cant really see it from the road. ??Honestly, I used to be in this area a million times through and I swear this isnt a place that I ever recall. ??  Im guessing from the interior, that this place has been here for a good ol while.  I came in and was promptly seated by the hostess, the dining area is large, but there werent too many people there on this date. ??We were seated in front of the fire- that was nice.  The lunch menu in ??my opinion is kind of small. ??You have a couple of options for a sammich or two, simliar entrees (as the sammiches) are available, but they may be slightly larger and come with more sides. ??I think the salad bar is what people come for, as it has both hot and cold items. ??The hot items for the salad bar differ based on what is available. ??You can get the salad bar by itself or as an addition to your lunch entree for a fee. ??  On this date, I had the salad bar, and what they call is their speciality - the prime rib. ??To be honest, I was less than underwhelmed with almost everything that I tasted. ??The salad bar looked good, but the ceasar salad was hardly dressed, and I questioned how often they replaced some of the items based on how some of the silverwared looked. ??The prime rib sandwich came with fries and au jus. ??It wasnt as flavorful as I would have preferred and it was rather fatty. ??The crab cake entree, was a good deal for the price, the cakes were alright, but had a nice bit of filler.  I did delight in the solitude of the space, it was quite a nice spot to have a catch up, the service was good, as was the lovely fruit and marscopone cake.   Happy to have tried a CP staple, but I wont purposely return.

This is a fantastic restaurant with incredible food and excellent service. Steaks are very high quality, seafood is fantastic and the salad bar is unbelievable. I highly recommend this place.

Overall a fairly decent, but flawed experience which unfortunately is typical. I had lunch here fairly regularly in the 1990s when I used to work nearby. It hasnt changed much at all.   We had dinner here recently - myself and the kids ordered prime rib which is a house specialty and my wife a sirlion steak. We all had the salad bar before our meal which hasnt changed in the 20+ years Ive been coming here. It contains fresh rolls, soup and salad choices fairly similar to what you would find at Ruby Tuesdays. I ordered a french onion soup which is also a favorite.  The prime rib/steak is cooked on a grill behind the salad bar. Ours arrived cooked per order. The cut of meat is quite good, but I think many will find the flavor pretty bland. Unfortunately my wife ordered her sirlion steak medium and it was not only fairly small for $29, it was well done. She notified the waitress and ??she took the steak back and exchanged it for prime rib which arrived promtly. My soup didnt arrive before dinner and I had to remind the waitress and she brought it out shortly afterwards.   Overall its nice to come here once in a while, but it isnt great enough to make our normal rotatation. See the entertainment book for coupons to knock down the price. They also have early bird specials.

Food was solid. Jerry and wife were excellent hosts. ?? Salad bar out...out...out..standing. Go Gophers!

Heres an interesting find... ??if you remember those wonderful prime rib places from the 70s you will surely ??love this place! Its not necessarily easy to find because the only sign they have for the restaurant is small, ??and its located behind another building.  Its worth finding if youre jonesing for a massive slab of perfectly cooked prime rib, served with a huge baked potato, ??preceded by a 30 long salad bar! ??The place is a time capsule--- I hope they never update it. (Although the bathrooms could use a minor freshening).   We also went with the desserts; ??apple pie with caramel and a tall(but somewhat slender) piece of chocolate cake.   We had a waitress named Sandra, I think; she couldnt be better. ??Attentive, knowledgeable, and got the order right. ??  Are you tired of chain steakhouses? ??Cookie cutter plasticky personality? ??Try this local restaurant!   Good for groups? Heck yes; ??they have at least two private rooms. ??No outdoor seating, so leave your puppy at home- but bring him some prime rib!

This restaurant has bad customer service. They serve food RAW!! The crabcake is BIG and BREADED!!! The manager is very rude!!!!

I dont mind stepping back in time to a classic type steakhouse but.... The salad bar was pretty sad and the mashed potatoes were quite bland so I held out that the meat would pay off. NOT!!! ??My prime rib came out still moo ing. Not medium rare or rare but raw. on top of that the slab o beef was a poor quality cut riddled with fat and not in the good way. I sent it back hoping I would get a better cut the second time around. Nope, the same piece a bit broiled on top. The only decent part of my meal was the friendly service.

13 New Yorkers who were here on business showed up to this quaint restaurant - all out of place, cranky and hungry. In typical New York fashion, after waiting 7.5 seconds for a hostess to show up, we decided to try to seat ourselves. Luckily, Jerry the owner came from around the corner to show us how its done. He sat us and politely and even though he wasnt our server, he held himself accountable to not only take our drink orders but also serve them to us while our server was tied up.   Once our server Tim came, he was just as accommodating. He successfully walked the tightrope of being perfectly accommodating without being overbearing. The timing of every refill, used plate removal and silverware replacement was so perfect that for the first time in a long time - I didnt have to think about my dining experience. I just got to eat and enjoy without lifting a finger. The Crab Cakes were delicious!!!  We are a high maintenance bunch who has seen the best of the best, and we all came away very impressed with Sir Walter Raleigh and will certainly be back next time we are in the area.

Nice, old fashioned steak house. ??Great salad bar. ??The crab cakes are outstanding, as good as any Ive had anywhere. ??Service is great, and any issues are addressed immediately. ??Ive been here many times and can give this restaurant high praise.

Always a great time and the food is always outstanding. The atmosphere is nice and staff is very friendly. Jerry, the owner, is very nice and personable. They have amazing prime rib and filet mignon, as well as chocolate mousse. A great place to have parties and gatherings, Ive always had a good experience here. Highly recommended!

The crab cake was excellent. My wife had the flat iron steak and it was ok. The salad bar was great.

Some of the reviews Ive read here are amazingly harsh. Our visit today is in very sharp contrast!  Jerry, the owner, brightened up the entire place by shaking every single customers hand, warmly greeting them and treating them like family.   Lamin Jobe proudly professed he made the turkey. Hes been serving up the food for a few years now. Now thats loyalty! And he is the best!  To the Yelper(s) who complain that this place looks dated: its supposed to be!!! Its called SIR WALTER RALEIGH for a reaoson. Youre talking about a figure who was born circa 1554!! What are yall expecting? A big slick dance floor and thumping party music with a glitzy mirror ball? How do you update colonial decor? Sometimes dated is underrated.  Personally, I love the rustic atmosphere, the inviting fire, and the charm of the wooden beams across the ceiling.   Regarding some reviews that complain about too many older people being their clientele, I find that kind of ageist. Yes, there were quite a few older folks dining there but so what?  Ill take em anyday over screaming bratty kids! These customrers were so kind and courteous. As soon as some of them heard it was my friends birthday quite a few personally came over to give her a hug! It was really heartwarming to see this kind of community at a restaurant. There was a wide range of ages.  Now on to the food. We both had the Thanksgiving Buffet. The stuffing was herbal and yummmmm. The gravy was tasty. The redskin mashed potatoes were delightful. The veggie lasagna was very thoughtful for people like us who dont eat meat (well, I eat fish!!!) Speaking of fish, the Crab Imperial was succulent. The salmon was cooked to perfection, The cranberry sauce was non-jellied with bursts of the individual chunks of cranberries...the green beans &amp; corn were refreshing. And the salad bar, as always, was really wonderful. Including smooth apple butter!  Our friendly waiter, Tim, surprised my friend with a slab of apple pie and a candle and Lamin darted over to sing Happy Birthday to my friend. My friend said that apple pie was among the best shes ever had with crumbly gooey goodness.  The only critique we have is of the manager (I think) named Mark (bald head). He didnt make us feel particularly welcome, but Jerry, the owner well made up for him!  We will definitely return next Thanksgiving...and in between too. Its quite a distance, but worth the trip!

Old Timey  I can get with the old time look. It gives me a down home, small town feel and I believe this country needs to get back to the basics. ??The service was nice and friendly.  I opted to start with the french onion soup, but then I realized that the salad bar is complementary with the entree, so I scrapped the soup. ??I should have went ahead and just got the french onion soup. ??The salad bar was disappointing and not flavorful. ??The beef stew was OK and the fruit was good, but the pasta was bland.   For the entree, I got the sirloin and french fries and I was satisfied with both. ??I got the carrot cake for desert and that was good. ??My friend got the baby back ribs and they were pretty good.  Give it a shot and go for the ribs.

Great food and service. ??Tim, our server, was excellent. ??Love that Jerry, the owner, always walks around and talks to each guest and especially thanks them for coming out. ??I have never ever had a bad meal here, the filet mignon is to die for and their salad bar is the best you can ever find.

I havent been to a Sir Walter Raleigh since the Wheaton location closed many years ago. Went with my BF last night and was very impressed with the food and the service.   I ordered the crab cake entree with the garlic mashed potatoes. The salad bar and rolls are included. All delicious. BF ordered the prime rib and loaded baked potato. The meat had lots of flavor, and the portion was big enough for two servings. And that was the early bird special size.   The restaurant was very busy, a tour group was in a side room as well as an almost-filled dining room. The servers were attentive, and cheerful. A very impressive group of servers.   I will most definitely be back soon. A very nice evening.

Prime rib is still one of the best you can get anywhere. ??Its been here for a long time to the decor shows it. ??They have parred down the salad bar but still good. ??Could use a makeover but the food is still great reasonably priced. Great hospitality from my waitress Sandra.

To begin we had the mussels. I liked them okay, I thought the fact that they were served in a kind of vegetable soup was creative, but it was marketed as a pinot grigio sauce, which it wasnt.   I had the blackened chicken breast. It was juicy and tasty, however I felt that it was over spiced. I had to cough after a few bites but it will make a fine chicken sandwich when I add a couple tablespoons of mayonnaise to it! Ordered the rice pilaf to accompany the chicken.. it was bland and without flair, and each grain was covered a ton if butter. Luckily I had my lemons from my iced tea which added a little something to it but I still didnt eat much of it and opted not to take it home.  We decided against dessert because between the two of us we had already spent nearly $100 on a meal that wasnt quite worth it. The service however was fantastic and our waitress, who seemed to be the only one working, was cool under pressure and did everything to make us happy. She belongs somewhere like Mortons. Not this place.

Great food, family atmosphere. Great services and the patrons as well as the staff are a pleasure. The food is very good. The prime rib is legendary as well as the burgers, crab cakes, steaks, and deserts. ??You will enjoy.

Where to start? I have heard mixed reviews of this place for years, but never actually ate there. When some friends were tasked with taking an out-of-town guest to get dinner (and she wanted steak), they suggested this place, claiming they had friends who absolutely raved about the salad bar. I thought... steak place with a salad bar, why not a Brazilian steak house, but thats neither here nor there.  So we get there, and this place is touted as fine dining. Carpets? Ick. I doubt they are steam cleaned even weekly. The decor is sad and hasnt been updated in decades.   The menu came and I looked over it. There wasnt a lot of option, but I figured its probably best to offer a smaller selection and do it well than offer a large menu of mediocre food. Right? (Guys, this is foreshadowing). I ordered a small sirloin steak, rare, with steamed veggies. It came with the salad bar.   The salad bar. You guys. No. Anyone who says this is AMAZING has never really eaten good food. There was one bowl of undressed baby greens, some actual cucumber slices, some fresh onion and mushroom slices, but Id say at least half of the contents of said salad bar were canned fruits or veggies. One bowl was pre-dressed Caesar salad with shredded mozzarella cheese on it. What? The rest of it were a few dubious-looking soups and sad pasta salads. This is not fine dining. This is a picnic with the relatives with no taste buds.  About 45 minutes pass and we get our entrees. Now remember, I ordered rare? It was done medium/medium-well. It was barely pink in the center, which is pretty far away from rare. My friend suggested I send it back, but at that point, Id rather choke it down than wait another half an hour for a mediocrely-cooked steak. The steamed veggies were decent, but served with a disposable (!) plastic (!) cup of something that looked like microwaved (!) velvetta (!) cheese. Utter disappointment.  Finally, I decided to just throw caution to the wind and order a dessert-the hot fudge brownie sundae, hold the brownie. The hot fudge was just industrial microwaved hot fudge sauce, and the ice cream was pretty average. And ah yes, served in a plastic soup bowl.   This? This is not fine dining. Cloth napkins dont cover the fact that the food is not very good, the place is run down, and the prices nowhere near justify the quality of food presented. Plastic doesnt belong in a fancy restaurant, either, but that might be just me.  The sad thing this is that I went to an Outback restaurant a few days prior. I got the same exact cut of meat, done perfectly, for about half the price. And I generally hate chain restaurants. Let that sink in for a few minutes. And then avoid this place.   At least my waitress was super nice.

I had a craving for veggies after my days errands, and was in the neighborhood, so I headed for the salad bar at Sir Walters, and joined the other geezers for the early bird (4-6 PM) specials. The clam chowder was a bit thick from sitting on the S&amp;S bar, but the clams were still tender. Not Lukes but better than most. The salad satisfied, nice fresh greens and other goodies, and crisp tangy coleslaw. I ordered the crab cake just because I had been talking about them with a fellow Yelper on Saturday. I should have taken my own advice about having low expectations when out of earshot of gulls. Nice lump meat, but too much breading - which to me means that you could tell that there was ANY breading. My recipe uses 4 crushed saltines per pound of crab. Standard baked potato, full strength brewed iced tea. I would also like to point out the slice-it-yourself bread on the S&amp;S bar. I was fortunate enough to catch some nice crusty rye fresh from the oven. If you see baguette shaped white bread, ignore it as it is fit only for feeding pigeons. For those who have not been there, the decor is country house - what my sister would call charming. Stucco walls, rustic pictures, pretty good date site. Theyve been there for decades for good reason. Foodgasm no, but a step upscale without busting the budget ($25 prime rib is the top of the menu) and a solid four stars.

Overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food. I ordered the crab cake platter for $24 without the salad bar! ??Nothing about the crab cake, coleslaw nor baked potato was worth mentioning. I wont be returning.

Thi$ review ha$ one $tar for one rea$on. The price. The food here wa$nt even a$ youd expect for the expen$e. The portion $ize wa$ not even enough for a $mall child. I ordered two crap cake platter$, and each were $24. The crab cake wa$ the $ize of a $mall potato. The potato nor cole$law were anything worth getting. Im writing thi$ to $ave you from wa$ting your money here. ??I will never be back.

I have only eaten the mussels but they were NOT fresh. Theyve been sitting and hoping that someone would order them for months. ??Im waiting on the rest of the food as ppl are coming in and ate forced to track down the hostess to be seated. ??(There are only two tables occupied). Looks like it used to be decent but the owner doesnt want to put any money into making it a real establishment.  Edit. ?? ??Just got my 35$ 16oz prime rib ordered rare. ?? Got it med and dry although its soaking in a plate of au jus sauce. ??Reminds me of a Vegas style buffet as far as quality.

Nice place to meet and eat great food recommended. buffet style restaurant with plenty of parking for RVs.

I have been to The Sir Walter Raleigh Inn a few times recently. I was particularly hungry last week after having worked since 7 in the morning and just had the urge to eat a good steak and salad with some vegetables and a nice desert. I had remembered going to the Inn sometime last year so just decided to go back. I was delighted to find the waiter extremely friendly and kind. He brought rolls to the table with slabs of butter and a huge glass of water and then took my order and gave me his best advice on a delicious entree. It came quickly and was quite warm which to me makes a good meal. I enjoyed the presentation and the attention that I got.  They keep the place very comfortable temperature wise and the atmosphere is so cosy. I believe it would be a great place to have a nice party and may just plan my husbands big birthday there in the future.

Ok where do I start. First of all upon arrival there is no one to greet you. My sweetheart called the restaurant in advance to see if reservations was needed. ??The gentleman that answered the phone said he was the owner. ??We then asked if they had the surf &amp;turf. Since thats what I wanted to have for dinner. He stated yes come on down so we was pleased and said ok good. We traveled quite some ways because we normally eat closer to home. ??Once we finally got seated which took a while since they have the waiter doing both jobs we were told that there is no lobster available. ??I was very disappointed because that was our main purpose for coming. ??While speaking to the owners we indicated that we were told that surf &amp;turf was available so they did apologize and offered a free desert to make up for the mishap. ??We both appreciated that so all did end well.

Had a great meal made by really nice people. The best salad bar Ive seen in a long time.

Service was good but everything else needs work. ??The food was fresh but very under seasoned. ??It was the first time Ive ever had to use steak sauce. ??The atmosphere was pretty old timey so I think this may be on purpose for the clientele thats there...

I went to this restaurant in May, 2015 with a group. The dinner was delicious and the decor was very colonial with lovely prints and paintings. I dont know how they managed to do it, but we all were served almost simultaneously and the food was hot too. A wonderful evening.

I like restaurants off the beaten path and the one and only places. Everyday I can go to a chain but I wanted something different. I think this place needs the likes of Kitchen Nightmare intervention ASAP. ??I noticed several senior citizens at this restaurant and the decor was fitting something from the 1960s. The staff was nice and the salad bar was a nice touch. I ordered the crab pretzel which was more of a crab spread, a burnt pretzel, and a glutinous amount of cheese. I ordered the vegetable lasagna which was salty and tasteless. The potato was hard and needed a little more cooking. I did not enjoy anything and even threw away my left overs. I think this restaurant needs a make over and the menu desperately needs some revamping.

Service was great. Met one of the owners. Nice atmosphere. Salad bar was nice. However our appetizer and entree was not seasoned at all. ??Steak looked inedible.

Talk about old! Back in the day, this was the place. Today? A tad old and dark. Cant even read the menu! I really believe they use the same plastic cups from 1975.

I would give it a higher rating if it didnt look so damn depressing. ??The furniture and walls are from the Flintstones. ??The salad bar is wonderful. ??Its just so depressing

If I can rate it zero star, I would. We were busy moving all day, and hungry so we stopped by here because it was close. OMG. Why did the salad bar was so cheaply (is that a word?) set up and the lettuce had bunch of water underneath? And the broccoli salad?? My appetite was gone. To make it worse, the utencils were disgusting. My husband was feeling the same. I felt horrible but when he said,  Im willing to leave this place. I can just leave $10 and go. So we told our waitress and left. Felt bad but I just couldnt do it. Oh. Why the waitress had a not-so-clean white shirt on? My husband pointed out. All I can say is, dont do it.

The Sir Walter Raleigh Inn is about the classiest restaurant in the College Park area. Not a particularly difficult achievement, but hey. I havent ordered any of the entrees here as they are a bit pricey, but the appetizers, soups, sandwiches, and salad bar are all reasonably priced.   The cream of crab soup is generously filled with crab meat, which is always a delight! The french onion soup comes in a pretty big portion as well. Also a fan of the mini crab cakes and the potato skins. The mussel appetizer is really great; tons of fresh mussels bathed in a savory sauce with only a couple closed ones. The french dip sandwich is also good, nice big portion.   The service is also quite good here, the wait staff has been friendly every time Ive been here.

I come here every so often to meet with friends to enjoy a dinner with some m-e-a-t. ??  Heres the sad part. ??It used to be a really nice steak house with a humongous salad bar with a ton of variety. ??Today...not so much.  Depending on when you go and what day it is the food is either great or...not so much. ??The day we went (a Monday) the place was far from crowded but, for some reason, the service was slow. ??  The waitress was attentive but getting the food from the kitchen to the table seemed to take forever. ??The asparagus I ordered with my teriyaki steak was way overcooked with a horrible sauce. ??The steak itself was cooked nicely and tasted great.  The salad bar has been reduced to something resembling a grocery stores salad bar. Limited ingredients. The homemade bread remains good!  This place has been struggling for years and I think part of the problem is that they are pretty expensive. ??Four people with drinks and dessert was about $125 with tax and tip after a discount coupon. ??Its definitely not the place you go once a week. ??  The price says special night out. The food and service says an OK place to eat.

This restaurant is sweet. In the apple pie way. Thats what Id call it. I had the honor of being introduced to the co-owner Ronnie. She told me all about the history of the place, since 1976 its been open! She was wonderfully nice to my friend and I while I ate my veggie lasagna and sipped my beer. They built a bank in front of us! she said. People should go here. Its cute. And, its just an experience on a night out. The crowd is older, but, who doesnt like stories of the old days! Delicious meal. Great night out. Excellent beer. Incredibly friendly staff. My waiter accidentally stepped on my foot (I had it out way beyond the table chair) and I think apologized over 10 times. He was very cool. Dine in (:

I had a martini and fillet and Crabcake. They were all done perfectly. The service was very good and the people were very friendly.

You should always be concerned when you walk into a restaurant and they are burning scented candles. Clearly they are trying to hide something. From my observation, it is the stench being given off by a dining room that has not been cleaned since Sir Walter Raleigh was actually alive! I am not sure who the people are rating this place with 4 and 5 stars on Yelp, but they must be staff or the owners. I am giving this place two stars instead of one only because the older gentleman that sat us was warm and friendly.   We went for lunch. The server recommended the hot/cold bar. The salad part of the bar was nothing special. The lettuce was old and the other items looked like they were dumped right out of a can. The only item from the hot part of the bar that looked appetizing was the fried chicken. Sadly, it was dry and tasted like it had been reheated multiple times.   Oh, when we asked for separate checks, the server shot the person that asked a look that caused us to nearly gasp. What a horrible experience! Please stay away. There are better options in the area.

a poor experience . the place is almost falling apart around you. broken fixtures, loose floor tiles, and a bit grimey.  the food was quite average and the salad bar was assembled without much concern for customer interest . I grant you that there arent many places to visit in this area but you are better off skipping this one altogether.

They have the best prime rib and cream of ??crab soup. ??The salad bar is exceptional and the owners personally come by to greet each guest. Back in the 70s &amp; 80s we use to go to the one on Gallows Rd. This maybe the only one left in the metro area. So if you remember back then or just want some great food you should try this Greenbelt location.

Whenever I am in the Maryland area as I find myself this week, I visit Sir Walter Raleigh Inn for a prime rib. ??The decor is a little dated but service is great, always with a smile. ??Prime rib exactly how you ordered it, comes with creamed horseradish sauce which is pretty darn good. ??Usually get the baked potatoes with the works. ??Prime rib comes in 3 sizes, if you are hungry get the extra thick cut, I generally go for the thick cut and I belly is full. ??This trip the Mrs. joined me, she liked her prime rib which is one of her favorite cuts. ??She also liked the bread and salad bar. ??A little sad today as they didnt have the usual soup bar which on and off has chili. ??This is just good old fashion service and a good meal at a fair price. ??I will always visit when I am in the area and if you like prime rib, try them out and I am sure your belly will be full as well.

Sighs. Im a carnivore and one day after a severe intense craving for steak and crab cakes, i decided to splurge. After searching, i found this place and i decided to visit. It was absolutely horrible. The decor is almost late 90s. There are no windows inside, the tables are cramped together (or maybe im just big). The floor had musty carpet. I was seated and offered a nasty looking menu. It was just so bad, but my craving for steak was more overwhelming. I was shown to the salad bar. cheap, tacky, disgusting, horrendous are few of the adjectives i can use to qualify it. The veggies were poorly sliced and looked old, the fruits were no better. I turned around and went to my table and waited for my food instead. The steak and crab cake finally came in. It was a reasonable size, but i asked for well done steak and i got what i can describe as a medium rare. -_________-. I decided to not make a fuss and ate it. The steak was NOT seasoned. The potato was bland as was the veggies they served with it. The ONLY good thing was the crab cake. I ate hurriedly and ran away. NEVER going back there. Its a place for seniors to relax, but if youre under 40 or even 30 please, dont go.

Imagine it is 1970 and you want to go to a fancy restaurant and you look for a place to go. Sir Walter Raleigh is it. The decoration has not changed since then, I am sure but that is part of its charm. They serve prime ribs and have old school food that is sure to appeal to the retro in all of us. This review, is not for any of that.   This review is about the Easter Buffet they offered.   College Park has buffets all over. My husband and I go to them all the time. We are fans of the Asian ones mostly but have been known to go to others. After having fed the masses (okay just my families) for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I thought that this Easter, we were going to go out. Sir Walters menu looked good and it was reasonably priced.   It was not a MEGA BUFFET like other places around but that was okay. WHY? Cause everything I ate (with the exception of the lamb -- which was terribly dry) was really good. I mean REALLY quite good. The salad bar had just enough items to make it fun without making into too much. ??The roast was delicious and the chicken was finger licking good (yes I said it)... Even the vegetable lasagna (Lasagna is supposed to have MEAT!) was very delicious)  The nice thing about the place is that it seemed to have all ages. Little kids up to little old ladies made up in their Sunday Best. ??We really had a nice fun time.   The husband and I would like to go back on another night and see what the rest of the food is about... Maybe then we will give it 5 Stars.

I went to the Sir Walter Raleigh with my homecoming date in the 12th grade. ??At 17, it seemed like a classy place. ??I probably ordered lobster - Im not a cheap date. ??  Years later, with my grown-up palate, I returned to the Sir Walter Raleigh. ??And I really cannot understand what I liked about it a decade before - or why anyone likes it, for that matter. ??The atmosphere is somewhere between a pub and a Red Lobster... but stuffier. ??The menu focuses on surf and turf, and theres a large salad bar you can get with your meal or order alone. ??Its all overpriced, and nothing is cooked particularly well.  Ive been a few times, since it remains a popular destination for business lunches. ??I ordered steak once, and it was tough and cooked well past the medium doneness that I ordered. ??The next time, I avoided red meat and went for seafood - which was greasy and rubbery. ??I had a club sandwich once that wasnt too bad. ??But how badly can you screw up a club sandwich? ??The salad bar is one of their most popular offerings, and its a mediocre salad bar. ??Theres oily soups at each end and fairly traditional salad fixings and fruit in the middle. ??Nothing special. ??The real highlight is the artery-clogging garlic bread that they hide in a basket near the soup. ??Its a bit sad that my favorite part of the restaurant is... bread?  The prices are quite high, though they sometimes have specials or coupons. ??They had an early bird offer for a while that was quite a bargain, and wed eat dinner at 5PM with all of the retirees looking for a cheap dinner before bingo. ??  I really just dont get the appeal. ??And I dont relish the thought of returning the next time a co-worker has a birthday.

Just like another poster if I could rate this place as 0 stars I certainly would. The decor is nice...until you notice the big screen TV in one of the rooms. The food is astronomically priced for the minuscule amount of flavour. Our waiter was very rude and paid little to no attention to us while we are eating. One of the bus boys even came and took my plate while I still had food in my mouth. I wouldnt go back here if someone paid me to. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

Not impressed. ?? I went here because I heard the food was great. ??I went during a buffet they had during a holiday so that made it over priced for starters. ?? Ive had much better for a lover price. ?? I may try them again on a regular day.

I had a great meal at the Sir Walter Raleigh Inn in College Park, MD. The service was awesome. My wife and I decided to take my son out to dinner to celebrate his 22nd birthday. ??This was his first trip to Sir Walter Raleighs and it was our first trip to the College Park location. ??Our previous experience with this restaurant was through its Montgomery Village location years ago. The waitress promptly took our order and kept an eye on our table. ??This was the best service I have had in recent memory. The owners were present and greeted the patrons. ?? Ronnie and Jerry added a nice touch through their visit to the tables. My son ordered crab cakes; my wife had sirloin and I had prime rib. ??The food came out as ordered and was delicious. ??The garlic mashed potatoes is something you dont want to miss. We all had an enjoyable dinner.

I came here for dinner this past weekend and the service and food was excellent. ??Our party was seated immediately and our server, Caroline, was friendly and attentive throughout the evening. ??The owners were also super friendly and came by to make sure everyone in our party was having a good time.  I loved the salad bar! Not too many places have salad bars like this anymore. ??For appetizers, our party ordered the mini crab cakes, and the bacon wrapped shrimp. ??For dinner, I ordered the center cut filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the prime rib. They were both delicious!  I loved the atmosphere and that you could actually hear everyone talking at your table. ??It was such a nice relief from other restaurants Ive been to recently. ??  We will definitley be coming back again!

Hit or miss. More likely to hit the bullseye with this classic, old school steak and seafood house and its large, fresh salad bar (with soup and bread) if the owner is on site, greeting people. When theyre not there, its a crap shoot, like dirty serving spoons at the salad bar.

Came in for the Maryland vs Michigan State football game from Michigan. We were looking for a good place to grab some steaks and crab cakes. Our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed. The crab cakes were phenomenal. The prime rib and filet Mignon were very good but we were hoping for a bit more steak selection. We loved meeting Jerrys wife but were disappointed to not meet the man himself. I would recommend Walters.

Not bad at all. Service (Claire) was awesome! Food...ok...good Ambiance...nothing to write home about but cozy and nice. Im a window kinda girl. Windows are really scarce once you get in the restaurant. Dark feeling but I wont complain...the food was good and we were all happy .....ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAD JUST EXPERIENCED THE WORST SERVICE EVER AT ROYAL JADE!

Very disappointed!  Short story- unfriendly service, mediocre-bad food, too expensive for the quality.  Long story- My husband and I were in town visiting from Mississippi. We went to longhorn to have steak earlier in the week but we prefer to visit local restaurants so we asked around for a steakhouse and Sir Walter Raleigh came highly recommended. I called to see what time they closed so we wouldnt be the aggravating last minute guests, we had over an hour so we went on. When we got there we were not greeted until my husband poked his head around a corner and someone came and sat us. She also asked for our drink order. I asked for a Coke, she asked if Pepsi was ok, I said no and asked for other options.... then settled on a water, this clearly annoyed our waitress. Another waitress came by and I asked if they carried any hard cider and she brought me an Angry Orchard.. Wasnt bad. Anyway my when I called I made sure they had ribeye (husbands favorite cut.. Steakhouses should carry it no question), when we ordered, it was some sort of teriyaki steak so my husband passed and reluctantly got the NY strip. I got a filet with crab meat. Both steaks were flavorless. My steak was soaked in hollandaise sauce with the crab mixed it. It didnt even look like it would taste good, which didnt deter me, I ate one if my 2 small filets. All the sauce had to be there for me to get it down!(I was super hungry). The NY Strip was dry and bland.  The only upside to the meal was the salad buffet bar and the baked potatoes.  I asked for another cider from our first waitress and she claimed they were out. A likely story. It also took her about 5 minutes to come back and tell me. For our 2 meals and 2 beers it was $81. We tipped $10... Less than our standard 20% no matter what. So $91 for a bad meal and bad experience with no alcohol to drown the pain.  It was just all around bad.

I was stunned after I read all of these horrible reviews on the site. I have been coming to Sir Walter Raleighs (SWR) for over 20 years and have always loved and looked forward to coming to this restaurant (my extremely picky family and friends who I have brought here have always loved it as well). ??Yes, I agree with some of the other rating that the d??cor isnt as modern as other restaurants; however, that has never affected my dining experience here. The salad bar is great. Whenever I come to SWR, I always look forward to the salad bar- the veggies and fruit are always very fresh and the bread is delicious. As far as the food goes, the sirloin steak is delicious. I have gotten the steak 20+ times and it has never disappointed. The service is always quick and there is never a line. The prices here are a little high for the Greenbelt area, but when you consider that most entrees come with an unlimited salad bar, it all evens out (think most chains charge 12-15 for an entr??e and 6-10 for a small salad).   The owners here are wonderful and I have met them numerous times.   This place is great for University of Maryland College Park students who need a place to take parents and visitors when they come to town. When I was a student at UMD, Im pretty sure my parents drove down so frequently to visit me just as an excuse to eat here.   Dont believe the negative reviews on this site and be sure to give this place a try!

I was recommended by a friend to have lunch here, and it being right across the street from where I work, I had no problem stopping in for lunch today. I loved the atmosphere of the place, it was so calm and peaceful, a nice getaway from work. The waitress was so incredibly nice, and the service was great too. I had a Reuben for lunch, and it was really good. I will definitely be making more frequent trips to the Raleigh Inn. My only regret is that I wish I had found out about this place when I started working around here 2 years ago. Great restaurant.

Very pricey for the quality. ??Place is run down and shabby with lights out, trash on the floor and broken fixtures in the bathroom. ??The food was OK but not enough for the prices. ??Steak was small, baked patato plain and and OK but small salad bar. ??Service was only OK.

I took my wife here for our anniversary, she got the crab cake and I got the prime rib. ??Both were delicious! ??Will definitely be going back more often. ??Keep up the great service.

We were there with a coachmen Rv rally. 106 people. ??As soon as we tarted the buffet, we were through in good time. ??The owner was very hospitable to everyone. ??The food was good for a buffet. ??I would recommend this for anyone who is hungry.

What a gem of a place. If you arent looking for it, you will miss it. ??The partner &amp; I got there early-ish (a little after 6 PM) last night for dinner. ??We pulled in the parking lot and there were almost no cars in the lot -- typically a danger sign for me &amp; I wont go in! ??I am surely glad I did! ??Extremely friendly staff, especially our waitress Archi. ??We were laughing because we ordered the same drinks, same meal and same doneness on our prime rib. ??She, without hesitation, made a comment about she and her bf have been together a while and often do that, too. ??Im impressed that the restaurant (and clientele!) are as gay-friendly as they were providing where this place is located.  Prime rib = excellent. Salad bar = not the biggest/best I have ever seen, but ample and everything was fresh and replenished often.  Overall great visit, will be going back in the near future!

My husband and I went there last night for Valentines Day. It was a last minute decision but turned out to be a great one! I hadnt eaten there since the 80s but was delighted to discover it was still open. An incredible flute player came to the table and entertained us with beautiful music. I ordered the prime rib which this restaurant was known for with the wonderful horseradish sauce, and my husband ordered the steak kabob. Our drinks came right away, and we enjoyed the incredible salad bar and fresh bread while waiting for our food which came at the perfect time along with the wine we ordered. I love it the both of the owners, a husband and wife came by our table and asked if we enjoyed our meal. This place has been around since 1970, but its still got what we came for ... great service, really good food, and friendly people. Its perfect for celebrating any special occasion. I loved the fact that it has carpeting which makes the restaurant QUIET. It seems to be a trend for many places these days to do away with that which makes the room incredibly noisy. I do wish the prices were a bit more reasonable but we did really enjoy our meal there.

This place is kind of hidden, drove right by it for many years, not even knowing it was there. Happen to have dinner here for a company party in one of their private rooms. Was amazed at how big the place is, you couldnt tell by just looking from the front view. Now sure how the pricing is since we didnt have to pay. Food was good though. We had a set menu, but looking around the place and seeing lots of options. I believe there was a buffet option. and there is a decent salad bar, nothing spectacular but none the less. Service was friendly nice atmosphere.

I took my neighbor out to dinner tonight at Sir Walter Raleigh in Greenbelt. All I can say was this restaurant, which promotes itself as being the finest in steak and seafood has truly gone done hill since the last time I visited this establishment 2 years ago... way overrated!!   Their menu is way overpriced. I &amp; my neighbor actually ordered one of the cheapest dinners on their menu which was $27. When the dinner arrived, it was refrigerator cold. I complained but my friend did not. Even heated, the filler &amp; broccoli was lousy. I was wondering where was the crab cause I couldnt see any? You would think at that price you would at least see crab??? Lol. When the waiter approached me &amp; asked me how my dinner was, I replied, Whos the chef? Wheres the crab meat?? The owner of the restaurant then approached me &amp; my friend. I then told her how much her restaurant has gone down hill, how overpriced the menu is, &amp; how they are ripping off the consumer... The owner was very apologetic stating We want you to be happy. Can we bring you cake &amp; coffee on the house?... I said, No. I just wanted to end my Sir Walter Raleigh nightmare...... She did one good thing &amp; did not charge us for the probably the worst meal I have had ever!!! I guess she belt bad &amp; made excuses for why the meal was not up to par. Unfortunately, this will deter me from coming to this restaurant in the future. They have lost my business.

Went on Mothers Day one of the WORST restaurants I have been to. The salad bar was a complete mess. They only had buffet this day and the chicken was under cooked, green beans all different shades of green, rolls hard &amp; cold the list goes on. Stay away. I will never go back. Some one needs to call the health dept.

I was hesitant ??to come here based on the Yelp reviews, but this place is has many 4 star ratings at other sites and I was in the mood for this kind of food. ??This is your fathers steakhouse, but sometimes thats a good thing. They do the classics and they do them well. ??The French Onion soup was really good. ??I would come back just for that. ??The prime rib was cooked perfectly, very tender. ??The salad bar was great. ??My only complaint was the margarine on the salad bar next to the (yummy) homemade bread. ??They had really good apple butter so the butter wasnt needed. ??But really, put out the butter, at least its natural.

Today I went to the restaurant to talk to the Owner, Jerry about using a room for lunch and party after my dads funeral. ??He was kind, patient, and easy to work with. ??He was willing to see what he could do to make sure our group would be comfortable and had access to whatever we needed- videos, music, etc.. ??We stayed for lunch and I had hawaiian chicken. ??It was delicious. ??The atmosphere is cozy. ??I love the fireplaces. My dad loved this place too and was a HUGE fan of the prime rib. ??I know he will be happy this is where we will celebrate his life.

Best prime rib Ive had in a while. Salad bar was fresh and delicious. Great service!!! Sara was a lovey girl. The decor was like a 70s movie, it is very charming. ??Cant wait to come back!

My 10 oz steak came out smaller than the 8 oz prime rib my friend ate. The meat was over cooked and the rice was tasteless. The meal was good because of the people I was with, but the food was not very good. The salad bar was by far the best part.

Excellent food and always top-notch service. Its completely hidden and not well marked, but dont be discouraged. On one hand, its your classic dinner club restaurant with a solid salad bar and good steaks, but this place manages to be even a little better-- a cozy fire place, good drink menu, and again, great service every time. I only give it 4/5 starts because I think the prices are a bit high all things considered, but Ill keep going back because the food is great.

Excellent food. ??Prime ribs, steaks and lobster tail superb. ?? ??I come here often

Had a very nice meal with my family. Salad bar, soup and steaks which were all good even for my picky eater teenagers. Service was very good!!!. There was a wait ??for main course to come out but we were busy talking and never complained at all. The waiter (dont remember his name unfortunately) came over to apologize ??and tell us that there were two large parties which was why our food was taking a while. At the end of the evening when he brought our bill he had given us a substantial credit to make up for the delay.  Would definitely go back again next time we are in the area.

My extended family and I went here after my sisters college graduation. ??I had read the reviews prior to eating here (thanks yelp) so I was prepared for the bad out of date decor. The menu for lunch was lack luster. ??The salad bar didnt seem to look appealing. ??I settled on a bbq chicken sandwich with fries. ??My food came out last and some how ended up with bacon on it. ??No complaints. ??But the sandwich was dry with very little bbq sauce and nothing else besides lettuces tomato and onion. ??The rest of my family seemed to feel the same way. ??A grilled chicken breast with a side? Meh ??And the service wasnt all that good. ??Our waiter kept disappearing. ??My family did order a dessert which they said was good.

I had the prime rib and it was EXCELLENT. The horseradish sauce was also a perfect complement. Meat was very juicy and cooked right. Staff was also very warm and welcoming and the drink selection was good. I liked the small comfortable environment and decor, made it feel like a nice family restaurant. Will definitely go again soon.

Ive been a fan of this restaurant for many years, although it had been some time since I visited here. ??I came here recently with two friends, and I have to say it is still the great restaurant I remembered. ??The staff was friendly, and the wait staff attentive without being overbearing. ??The atmosphere was wonderful -- sitting by a fire on a cold evening. ??And the salad bar is still one of the best. ??Great caesar salad, and all the add-ons for regular salad. ??I had the prime rib with whipped horseradish sauce, and baked potato with everything. ??The prime rib was cooked perfectly. ??All in all a very pleasant evening, and I will definitely try to visit more often.

I went to the Sir Walter Raleigh Inn in Gaithersburg for so many years. ??I loved their fish and prime rib. ??The Gaithersburg location has been closed for a long time. ??My family and I were in Greenbelt about a week ago and decided to go to the only Sir Walter Raleigh that is open which is in Greenbelt. ??My experience that night was AMAZING! ??Just like how I remembered it. ??Customer service and food was exquisite! Sir Walter Raleigh is a GREAT restaurant for kids! ??The childrens menu is good too! I will definitely go back soon!

HOW I PAID ALMOST $35 FOR A SALAD AND A GLASS OF ICED TEA - I am so bored with chain restaurants. ??I have a huge project at work and I was in the office for 11 hours today. ??Driving home along H Street and the aromas coming out of the restaurants in Chinatown made me hungry. ??I could smell garlic and meat grilling. ??I have greatly reduced how much beef I eat, so when I do want it I want it to be special. ??Im not asking too much, Im willing to pay. ??Continuing my drive home from the office I begin to contemplate where I can get a good steak. ??Carrabbas? ??No, too much garlic. ??Outback? ??Nah, Im tired of cookie cutter food. ??OMG! ??Sir Walter Raleigh Inn! ??Oh Yeah! ??Detour! ??I guess my expectations were too high. ??I thought Id get a tasty steak. ??I thought Id get great service. ??Ive been going here for at least 30 years, I knew I could expect an excellent meal. ??It has been my experience that food made with love tastes best. ??I guess the honeymoon is over at SWRI. ??I ordered the small prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes and a glass of iced tea. ??The meal comes with salad bar. ??The salad bar was fine, but not even a shadow of it former magnificence. ??The person who delivered my prime rib spilled the juice all over my table and then walked away. ??I had to clean it up with my one cloth napkin. ??The napkins, BTW, smell rancid. ??I asked my server for extra napkins and she brought three paper napkins. ??Paper. ??Oh, one linen per person? ??She also didnt offer to help me clean up the mess. ??Then she was gone. ??The mashed potatoes were fine, very nice actually, but mine had lettuce in it. ??Where did the lettuce come from? ??I tried not to think about it. ??Then I trimmed the fat off the prime rib. ??Took a bite. ??It had no flavor at all. ??It didnt even taste like meat. ??I was expecting it to have been roasted in a wonderful mix of seasonings like Id had in the past. ??I took another bite or two and couldnt eat any more. ??I pushed the plate away. ??Waiting, waiting, waiting. ??The server finally came. ??She didnt ask how my food was. ??She asked if I wanted a box. ??I said, no, and that I did not like the steak at all. ??She whisked the steak away. ??I thought she was taking it to the manager. ??A few minutes later she returned with the bill and said she had taken off 10%. ??Now my bill was about $30. ??I dug out $30 and another $3 for tip. ??I looked around for a manager, but didnt see anyone. ??Completely insulted, I left. ??My wallet was raped. ??Does it end here? ??No. ??I called the restaurant and the manager tried to blame me saying I shouldnt have left without talking to him. ??The server never offered the opportunity to talk to him. ??The manager said he couldnt help me because I didnt know my servers name. ??Thats ok. ??Heres my $33.00 review. ??Its more than a little sad to see the direction this once fine establishment has taken.

I went here with my grandmother and two aunts while they were visiting. We really liked the old school/colonial feel of the interior of the restaurant, but the service wasnt all that great. When we first got there we were wandering around in the front hostess area for a few minutes and no one came out to greet us, eventually my grandmother just walked into the dining room until she got someones attention. After we were seated, service was a bit slow. Aunt #1 and I both ordered the vegetarian lasagna, aunt #2 ordered prime rib, and my grandmother got the terriaki chicken. All our meals came with the salad bar and bread. The salad bar was okay, standard run of the mill salad bar, but everything was fresh and tasty. The bread, on the other hand, was a cut it yourself type and looked like it had been touched by everyone else in there, so I passed. Our lasagna was supposed to come with garlic bread anyway. ??So our food comes out, and the lasagna is so so, but my aunt recalled we were supposed to get garlic bread with it, when my aunt asked the waitress, she gave us a terrible attitude and told us they didnt have any. There was really no reason for the tone of voice when she told us that, and really, she should have said something per-emptively and not forced us to ask. My grandmother thought her chicken was okay, my other aunt didnt say anything about her prime rib. We also brought my boyfriend home some ribs, he said they werent anything special and that the cesar salad was greasy. The owners came out and talked to us for a bit, and they were really nice, but it was really awkward listening to the manager hitting on the (drunken) ladies at the next table for 10-15 minutes. This place is a bit out of my price range to be able to visit with any sort of frequency, but its just okay anyways, nothing special.

Sir Walter Raleigh Inn brings me back to the past. Its overall very nice. They have a big salad bar. Im not a big fan of it, but they do have a big selection. Salad bars are not my favorite personally, but if you do enjoy they..they pretty much have everything! I accompanied my mom for a work party there. There were 18 of us. The menu was a bit outdated because some of the dishes they wanted, the restaurant no longer made. I ordered the baby back ribs with fries. It was a big slab and it was cooked well done. My mom ordered the salmon and it looked delicious. They gave big portions, which was great. The desert was the best part! I ordered the lemon and berry mascarpone cake. It was a huge slice and it was so delicious I finished it. It was very rich and everything it should be! My mom ordered the triple layer chocolate cake, very rich and big portion as well. Overall, this restaurant is very nice, try it sometime!
