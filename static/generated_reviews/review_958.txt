3.5 Stars. ??Third stop of the night of my MD adventure, although, I guess this is not MD. ??Close. ??I dont know how my friend finds these places, but Im glad she does. ??First of all, Turntable Restaurant &amp; Disco is kind of an awesome name, right?  I love dive bars and I love reggae and this place is the diviest reggae place Ive been to in a while. ??It was very small and very slow when we stopped by. ??The music was pretty good. ??It was really dark and tiny and there was one older guy dancing away by himself of the little dance floor. ??Another drink and I probably would have joined him. ??Speaking of the drinks, mine was very strong.   I met some interesting folks in here. ??We didnt stay very long, but I would come back for a very (very!) low key night. ??Another friend of mine told me that during the day they serve some of the best Caribbean food in DC. ??I would be interested in checking that out, too.

We went for lunch. ??The food was good, the service was friendly. ??We had brown stew, jerk chicken, beef patties, and plantains. ??I am a fan of the food. ??The place itself smelled of mildew and seemed a little dirty. ??Also, while the service was friendly, it was a little slow. ??I would go back if in the area. ??As long as you are comfortable with modest

OMG!!! The worst reggae place Ive ever been to!!! First of all, theres a 10 dollar cover, for what?!??! Upon entering the place you are immediately hit in the face with the smell of MILDEW!!! Ohh hell no! I was so pissed , I went and sat down, its so small in there i was sitting at a table right next to the DJ. the crowd consisted of mostly mid 30 and older, My friends and I are in our mid 20s except for one, of course she was the one who suggested this stinky place. The bar is small and limited. the dance floor is a big enough for 10 people,bathroom looks like a closet. After being there 20 Mins I asked the manager can we have our money back, he looked at me like i was crazy, and said  we dont give money back!!!! I could tell it was going to be more of hassle then needed. So we just left. NEVER AGAIN!!!
