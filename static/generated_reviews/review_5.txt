Ive come in to this location ??twice. And Ive ordered delivery maybe twice as well. Over all a solid place for the area.   Service so quick and precise and efficient. Not overly friend but not mean either so thats Ok. ??Some of my fav dishes are the Ka-Pow- I am not even kidding thats what it is called -  and the spring rolls. The I think their satay isnt very good so I would steer clear or that and I dont particularly care for their curry dishes.   Usually about $25 for 2 people. So like I said solid place.

Extremely small place! I recommend going with no more than 3 people, Id even say stick to a party of two.  My boyfriend and I had the Drunken Noodles and Massaman Curry.  First, the portions are tiny for the price we paid and the dishes werent even good.  The drunken noodles came out first and then the massaman curry came out about 10 minutes later. The drunken noodles came out at the same time as another table who also ordered drunken noodles. Their dish looked a lot more full and it felt like our dish were the extras from their dish. The portion was poorly distributed.  After, the server kept telling us that the curry is coming out soon and apologized for the delay. It was awkward to have half of our order come out first, the kitchen should have timed it better because by the time the curry came out we had already finished the noodles.  --Drunken noodles- bland and not spicy enough.  --The Massaman curry- the curry was okay, but the potatoes were hard and undercooked.  Pricey for small portions that arent even that good, we will not be returning.

First time, I thought that it was a really small portion for the price. I ate the Panang curry. It was nutty and sweet, very sweet, , need some more spice. Ask for the chili paste if you want it to have a little spice. Service was a little slow, but taking away the plates and everything makes me feel hurried even when theres no one.

Ordered Pad Thai to go and I thought it was pretty good. The great thing about the to go orders is that the portion is huge! So I could definitely get two meals out of it. As far as the pad thai, I wish it had a little more flavor or came with a lime. But nothing a little sriracha couldnt fix to add some spice! ;)   Overall, for a little over $10 you can get a large amount of yummy Thai food. Will definitely come again when Im craving Thai food around the College Park area.

This is my favorite Thai restaurant. The Pad Kraw Pow and Panang Curry are my favorites. I always get mango sticky rice and they always have it. Thai Tea is delightful. Theres nothing to not like about the food here.

Wow. I was really looking forward to this. What a disappointment.   I tried calling three times with no success. So I tried their online ordering system. Drunken noodles with chicken. I added a note to make it extra spicy.   It was ready when I arrived. They lost internet so there was an issue with the card going through. I open it up and there is not only not extra chili but theres no chili.   These noodles are dry, salty and bland. No spice. Im really upset and if I didnt have a meeting in Stamp, Id be bringing it back.

I love this place! It is my go to spot when I crave Thai food. The food is always full of flavor. My favorite is the drunken noodles dish.

The food is pretty good, but its not a place you enjoy sitting at, and the prices are not cheap. I think that only if you live right there it worth trying.  The place is super small and very simple.  Service was so so (if we needed something they immediately brought it to us, but we had to go to the cashier and ask for it because our server didnt come to check in with us).  I took the Papaya salad ($6.95). It was ok but I wouldnt take it again. I also took the Pad ginger with tofu ($10.95). It was pretty good, I liked the combination of the flavors. My friend took the green carry with vegetables. It also came with tofu actually. It was spicy, but not too much.

First time eating here and the experience was great. Friendly staff and the food was amazing. I had the Green Curry which was perfect for the cool weather, Thai ice tea to wash it down and Mango sticky rice for dessert (delicious.) Best Thai place in town, hands down!

My go-to comfort food is Thai and this place hits the spot every time, whether its dine in or take out. My favorites include the panang curry, the pad Thai (theirs is more on the saucier side), pad eggplant and curry puffs. ??Sometimes I treat myself to a yummy Thai iced tea. Out of all the food choices available in college park, this is one of my tops.

Why is it so hard to find a Thai restaurant around here that has a spice tray??! I shouldnt have to explain what that is to Thai restaurants. Ex: vinegar w/jalape??os, fish sauce w/hot chilies, etc..

This is probably my favorite Thai place, considering Ive been to Ellicott city, Rockville, Catonsville, and college park Thai locations.  Their pad Thai has stronger sauce than usual, so if you dont like that, go to another place. however, I love it so I come here all the time!   the portion is great and other dishes weve tried is also great. the fried rice is also great, not too greasy and not too heavy, just the way I like it. weve also tried drunken noodle which is ok.   their lunch deal is definitely the best, they give you an appetizer, entree and tea/drink. try to take advantage!   one star off because their service is still bad, even considering the usual reputation. they bring you the check even before youre done or right when youre about to finish your food. it ruins my appetite sometime but the food itself it pretty good

Although the space is tight, the quality of service and food makes up for it. I had drunken noodles with seafood. I enjoyed myself and would visit again.

I dont know why I never gave this place a chance while at UMD, but Ive been a couple times now and the food is excellent! They have a good lunch special (which seems to have gone up in price based on some other reviews). For $10.95 you get a drink (+$1.00 if you want a Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee), an appetizer (Tom Yum soup or spring roll) and one of ten entrees (+$1.00 for beef and +$2.00 for shrimp/seafood). The lunch special only runs on weekdays until 3 pm.   I ordered a green tea, spring roll, and the Pad Ka Pow with chicken. The spring roll was delicious! You could tell it was freshly made and came out piping hot. As for the Pad Ka Pow, it was red and green bell peppers, onions, Thai basil and chicken in a brown gravy. On the menu it has two peppers next to the name indicating that it was one of their spicier menu items, however it wasnt spicy at all to me. But then again, I do have a high tolerance for spice. I asked the waitress for a spice tray and add some to my meal which made it perfect. Id also recommend trying their Panang curry and curry puff appetizer. Both were very flavorful.   Service was a little slow, but the place was packed and I think there was only one waitress on staff. Also, this place does get pretty crowded (probably from the great lunch special and the fact that they can only seat about 15 people), so Id say get here early before the lunchtime rush starts! Theres some metered spaces out front, but otherwise I would say walk if you can.

I went to the place to have some talk over and have some food along with my friend. We got a good seat and got enough time to decide on what to eat and to continue our talk. After much deliberations I tried the noodle and the fried rice. I parked the car a bit far as I couldnt find any parking near by. I really liked the service. Very nice place, beautifully decorated with painting. A good place to have tasty food.

I was very excited to find out there was a Thai restaurant up the road. My friend told me about it so we had dinner that same night.   Upon entering I noticed the space for seating is very small. They dont have many tables. Majority of the people that were entering the door were coming to pick up their orders.   I ordered the tofu Panang curry that came with a small bowl of rice. The food was delicious. When I was walking to the bathroom I peered into the kitchen and they looked very clean. They had raw meat shanks laying around so I know the food doesnt come prepackaged.  The pricing was kinda high for a CP hole in the wall restaurant. The Panang curry will run you $11.59-13.50 depending on your choice of meat. The pricing is the same as some nicer Thai places in the DMV   The bathroom was scary. I have never yelped about a bathroom before. It was really bad so I would either hold it or go before entering the restaurant.

My husband and I stopped this cute little place for dinner. We shared the following dishes:  Tofu and veggies stir-fried with basil leaves in chili sauce Green Curry with chicken  I thought the food was delicious with the right amount of spice. The portions were plenty.  Service was really good. I wish this place existed when I went to UMD 10+ years ago.

Decent Thai very near the south end of UMDs College Park campus.  Its a small, no-frills space with table service and a counter optimized for carryout. The lunch special is a very good value, otherwise entree pricing is about normal.  I had the beef Ka Pow lunch special on this first visit, its a generous portion compared to what most placed serve for lunch. Flavors were good and heat on this 2 pepper dish was moderate.  For the special, you get to pick soup or spring roll, pick the protein or veggies for your dish (beef and seafood cost more than the others), and a fountain drink. Upgrade to a Thai Iced Coffee or Thai Iced Tea for a dollar. My Thai Iced Coffee was substantial (tall glass) and flavorful-- not bad considering that would be $3-4 by itself at most placed.  With 10 or so entree choices, this is definitely the way to go before 3pm.  Not the prettiest place to sit, and the spice-level could be amped up a little, but easily good enough to add to your local lunch rotation.

I would recommend their pad Thai if you go! It was warm and just the right amount of spices. I ??wasnt a huge fan of their fried rice, didnt have as much flavor.

Ive been coming here for two years, and the food is your standard Thai fare. I typically get the Pad Ka Pow with beef and Tom Kha Chicken Soup. Both are very flavorful. The Pad Ka Pow features flavorful sauce and plenty of veggies, however, the beef can be a little chewy when eaten fresh. I usually have leftovers and the beef tastes better after its had a chance to soak in the sauce.This is the only Thai place Ive been to that adds tomatoes to the Tom Kha soup. Its a unique flavor profile that I like since I love tomatoes, but others may be turned off.  The staff is so nice and friendly. They always remember me and will point out when I havent ordered from them in a while lol.   Overall, theres no wow factor to the food. Yet its the best choice for Thai in College Park.  3 stars for the food plus an extra star for the staff.

Amazingly good Thai selections, friendly service, and some of the best cooking youll get in the area. We had Thai chicken wings, Pad Thai, and Massaman Curry. If you eat inside its best to take the table away from the front door. The entrance is small enough that the door may hit the aisle chair.

Service: The serving and managing staff here is extremely cordial and makes things easy and efficient. Theres not much I can say here other than that.  Food: I personally think this place has the best Thai food in the College Park area. I normally get drunken noodles with extra chicken and tofu. I think this is the first restaurant at which I have asked for my meal to be made spicy, and received what I wanted. It wasnt spicy enough to make me spit fire from my exhaust, but definitely wasnt mild either. As always, the spice mill is served with the meal, so if you prefer to make your food THAT spicy, the option is always available. Thai coffee is made pretty well, not too much condensed milk. I usually end up paying about $20 including a good tip/tax for a meal so no complaints from the wallet!  Environment: One warning I will give, is that the restaurant probably seats like ten people. As much as I wish there was more seating, I feel there isnt any need for it. Most people order carry out but the dining experience here is still pretty nice! Keep in mind that College Park is a college town, and there are few restaurants which have lush decor and spacious seating. I would almost classify this place as a hole in the wall, but the food is well worth the lack of boujie aesthetics.

This place is great! I ordered togo which took a reasonable amount of time for authentic Thai food. The Pananng curry tofu(I add brocolli and carrots) was really good . Spring rolls were good too. I ordered sticky rice which was cooked perfect and was sweet and it had the perfect texture :)  The only let down was the Iced Thai tea, it was bitter and super concentrated ??I had to have the waiter add milk. I got home and it was still too bitter and strong so I ended up adding more milk and a pinch of sugar... That made it perfect.   The environment to me is not one Id prefer to dine in but I would if I had to. Either way Ill be back for more

They do delivery but have to order one hour before. Everything is pretty good. Tried Phaithai, Fried rice. Shrimp stew. Iced coffee is a little bit sweet to me.

Food was okay, definitely above average. The person next to me order Tom Yum soup, which I didnt, but I could just smell and tell that it was cooked the right way. However, my complaint is with their service. It seems that they were severely understaffed--at least during my visit. I mustve spent an hour sitting in there, but I got two cups of tea in total. Let me translate: that means for about 50 minutes of that hour my tea cup was empty. Oh, did I mention I had to ask for sweeteners *twice*, because they took them away from me as soon as I used some for my first cup of tea? Wondering what that means...

Like the bright orange wall color. The food is very tasty and service was good. They are more of a take-a-way then a sit down restaurant. This is due to it only sits 20. We got there right after they opened on VD and got a table with easy. They do not have a liquor licensee, which I do not fault them for not having. It is no easy task in getting one in College Park. After we finished dinner our check came with mini cup cakes.

The first time I ordered from here there was a piece of chicken in my tofu. The second time I ordered from there my order was incomplete and cold. I was very disappointed with my experience.

So good! Been here so many times and I keep coming back even though I live so far. Service is very good and the food is so yummy!

The most recent delivery order from Aroy was fantastic. My group got pad see ew, drunken noodles, and chicken pad thai. It came 15 minutes before they said it would, and it was so hot and delicious. Best Thai in College Park.

Ive only been here twice so I feel that I cant fully justify a 5 star review. I love the food here! The drunken noodle is a top favorite and was spicy &amp; delicious. I also had the massaman curry and it was just as delicious. The dining room is a little small but the atmosphere feels authentic. I will be back time and time again.

Still ordering from Aroy Thai, and still satisfied with every order. ??Service is friendly and several times they deliver sooner than the time given when I call. ??As for the food? ??Generous amounts, and everything tasty; Im addicted to their beef salad, its spicy/salty/oh so good.

I ordered delivery from here the other day through the yelp app. ?? So excited to find a good delivery option around here that isnt pizza or Chinese food!  We ordered the Chicken Satay (came w/4 skewers), House Salad, Curry Puff (came w/ 2 small puffs), and Chicken Pad Thai. ??Everything tasted great and the portions were large! ??We will definitely be ordering from here again! ??  Just a side note - the delivery took just over 2 hours. ??When we called to check on the food they apologized and said that they got backed up last minute. ??The food was really good so we will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Food is really good here! Its a small place but so clean and fancy restaurant ! It was def. good choice for a good lunch ??if you love curry ??recommended !!!!!!

So I decided to randomly try out this spot in College Park one day. I had a craving for drunken noodles (my go to at most Thai restaurants). Sadly, my selection did not satisfy the craving I had and Im not sure I will be inclined to try this place again, maybe I need to try another item from their menu. I asked for mine to be extra spicy and for someone who can handle spicy food, it was mild at best. The location is very convenient for college students (not sure about the price). At the time, I was the only patron in the restaurant, but it was also around 3:30 p.m. so I probably missed the lunch rush. I did notice the menu had some lunch specials!

I was recently staying at the Hampton inn in College Park and wanted something to eat without having to go out. ??I came across this restaurant and decided to give it a try.   I ordered the curry puffs: smaller than what I anticipated. ??The dough was flaky with a slight crunch to it. The filling was tasty, not spicy, and just enough curry to not overpower the dish.   I also ordered the Pad See-Ew with shrimp (for an additional ??$2.00): For the extra two bucks I spent I got a grand total of 4, count em, 4 shrimp. The noodles were cooked well along with the broccoli. Overall a good taste.   For the amount of food they serve in my personal opinion the price should be ??$1-3 less.  Ok, this is why I gave it only 2 stars...I am sitting in my room waiting for a knock on the door and instead I get a phone call. This is your Aroy driver and Im in front of the hotel. ??I then ask why she isnt delivering to the room and her response was I would rather stay in my car. ??Heck, I would rather have stayed in my room. If this was a cash order I would have immediately canceled! ??I have ordered from different restaurants to ??this location before and this is the first time a driver refused to come up.   So with that being said, this was my first and last order with them. ??  The hotel also offers suggestions for delivery locations in each guest room. Im going to recheck that book because if this place is in there Im going to suggest they remove it as a delivery option.

My first impression of the restaurant was aww they have fake food display at the window... Seen things like this is Asian movies, kinda cool to see one in real life. Entering I still felt the same way, it small and cozy with small tables.. Everything was very close together. I did a pick up so I didnt experience eating there. When I called hey were super friendly and even called back to add more food because of the service. The price is very affordable and for the price you really get a lot of food. Didnt wait even 5 mins to get my food, it was waiting for me *thumbs up*. I tried the free candy while paying and its sooooo delicious! Never tasted anything like it before and now Im addicted and want more!! Haha will be visiting more often now, oh and parking is so easy found one right in front of the store... awesome!!

PadThai noodles tasted extremely stale and the curry was too runny. Also, a bit expensive for the quality.

I always always always order from here when I need my Thai food fix. They have great food making the long delivery times, worth the wait. I have been to this location a few times and the employees are always nice. Mainly, I order delivery rather than eating there. The guy who deliveries is very nice as well. The food is incredible and flavorful. I always get the spring rolls and Pad Phed (eggplant, bamboo, curry sauce, and peppers) with shrimp. It is SOOOOOO GOOOOD! I have never had Pad Phed before - Aroy was where I tried it and ever since then, it was love at first bite. The spring rolls are great too! Always crispy, lots of veggies inside, and the sauce that comes with it is addicting. One time they did give me peanut sauce with my spring rolls instead of the yummy sweet and sour that usually comes with it; but thats the only true negative I have for this place. Overall, I love Aroy! I am very picky when it comes to Thai food but they won me over.  Favs: Pad Phed and Spring Rolls  Would Change: Fast delivery but I can deal with it for the incredible food!

Food is tasty here. I could have been warned that for the price of the food, youre really only getting a tasting menu. (This is not the lunch special.)  We ordered the tofu panang curry and some pork pad dish and a glass of thai iced tea. It was good. I would come back here.  Service, on the other hand... They really tried their best but they are understaffed. One customer actually walked away because he seated himself and was waiting for a while to even be acknowledged. I feel bad for them.  They better get service together if they want to succeed in the high turnover downtown college park area.

When youre a hole-in-the-wall place that seats no more than 20 people, there isnt a large demand fluctuation. ??You have 1 to 20 people, plus deliveries. ??So on a typical busy Saturday night, there was absolutely no excuse why we had to wait 25 minutes for our one appetizer to arrive, and 40 minutes for one plate of fried rice dining in. ??  The food actually tasted decent, between our beef noodle soup, seafood Thai fried rice and a chicken dish. ??The broth was delicious, and the fried rice had great flavor. ??Though the beef was overcooked and they skimped on the seafood.  I would definitely come back if we waited only 15-20 minutes for our food, which I think is fairly reasonable by restaurant standards. ??But because Im still annoyed by their lack of respect for other peoples time, its going to take old age and a few dozen drinks for me to mentally overcome the horrific memory.

The FOOD is Trashy, FlavorLESS, Pad Thai is sweet and Panang Curry is even more sweet, really? On top of that the Spicy Thai Rice had big chunks of Tomatoes (Thai??) and SALTY as H__L, plz do not bother to complain about the food because the lady will argue and not care. ??Not worth it all, no basil in Basil Fried Rice and No Flavor, it was really disgustingly disappointing. Save your $$. Please do no go here.

This place cooks drunken noodles really well. Its extremely convenient to where I live and service is always friendly and fast. A little pricey for the College Park area, but worth it.

Im in town for a friends wedding this weekend and decided we needed to try the Thai food in the area. We yelped some restaurants in the and Arroy came up first. ??Had the best reviews and was the closest to our hotel.  Food was super delicious and flavorful. Definitely beats most of the Thai restaurants Ive tried in New York. Staff was very friendly and pleasant. Presentation of the food was also very appealing.  We were seated right away and our food took less than 10 minutes to arrive.   Only complaint I have about this restaurant is that they ran out of the Thai iced tea. Other than that, I definitely recommend this restaurant for some delicious Thai food in College Park!

Tiny Thai Takeout  Yes, Im a sucker for alliteration. ??Apparently, Im hard to plan for b-day wise. ??I told my gf that I was in the mood for Thai. ??She found this spot and it was nice and cozy on a Saturday night. ??  The place is really a takeout spot with a dining option. ??Its very small inside - so small that if Scottie Pippen were to walk in and spread his arms, hed probably cover the width of the building. ??It appears to be mom and pop and the customer service is very personable. ??The staff was slow on the water refills, but I attribute to them being more of a carryout than a restaurant and they made up for it with the hospitality.  The food was very good. ??I started with the chicken satay, which is always a safe bet. ??I followed with the ginger chicken, which was well seasoned along with white rice.  A tiny place deserves a tiny review, but they have big taste, so give it a shot.

This is pretty good food, if you ask for any type of spicy even a little spicy they will make it really hot. So if you dont eat spicy, just say no spicy. The portions are big compared to other Thai places. I would go give it 5 stars but they did make the food too spicy even when I asked for little spicy. But overall good food and good sizes.

Favorite Thai place in the area. Tiny dine-in area but so delicious. Also good portions. I recommend the Pad See Ew and the pangang curry.

The food is solid here.   The massaman curry I ordered was not as flavorful as others Ive had but was fresh. My son enjoyed his panang curry more.  Its a small place and has cramped seating. They are probably doing the best they can with the space theyve got.  The service is just average. We got some mixed signals about what table we could sit at when we arrived. So, our welcome was not as warm as I would have liked it to be for our first time there. Felt a little devalued by this confusion, like they were saving better tables for others who might come later, but Ill give Aroy the benefit of the doubt.  The prices are reasonable.

No, definitely not 4-star quality. Yelp, you have failed me.  My boyfriend and I stopped by on our way home from a MD excursion. The restaurant is TINY, but we didnt mind. We love mom n pop shops! One of the ladies split a table for us to sit at, which was a bit awkward because we were only an inch away from our neighbors.   We arrived at 7pm. I know for a fact because thats when I checked in. No one came around with drinks for us after we sat. Ten minutes later, we finally had to flag down someone for our drinks and to order. We ordered chicken satay, drunken noodles, and green curry.   Time passed, and it became 7:45pm. Finally, one of the ladies came to us with an entree, but it was the wrong food. They had completely forgotten to put our order in! We got our order around 8pm, after they hurriedly put in the order. We got all three dishes at once. So much for our appetizer..   The food was not great. Chicken satay was a little dry and stringy. The green curry was fine according to the boyfriend. However, my drunken noodles were awfully bland. Even the color was off-putting. We usually dont ever send back food, but it was bad enough that my boyfriend had to call one of the ladies over and ask if it was done properly. Maybe it was a rushed job in the back and were missing some ingredients? The lady assured us that thats how they do drunken noodles. We told her it was bland and void of any taste, and if she could do something about it, and she didnt seem to understand what she could do to it. We went back and forth for a bit until my boyfriend just finally asked for some chilies in fish sauce, which she complied with right away. The spices helped some, but it was just too much work for us to get our food and have it be edible.   I would have given them a single star if it wasnt for the ladies who apologized often and comped the chicken satay. However, the food just wasnt good enough to merit more than 2 stars.

I just ordered take-out from here, and the quality of the food made me stop everything I was doing to post a review! This may be the best Pad See Ew Ive ever had: flavor is <a href=/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&amp;s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e rel=nofollow target=_blank>bomb.com</a>! It was piping hot too when I got home. Oh! The customer service was was pleasant and accomodating as well. I will definitely be back!

Finally, decent Thai food in College Park! ??Aroy is a small, family-run restaurant that has a solid core menu of classic Thai curries, soups, rice dishes, and noodles. ??Everything Ive tried has been tasty, maybe not quite as nuanced in flavor as my favorite restaurants downtown, but still very good. ??Im especially partial to their salads, which have a spicy lime-based dressing that packs quite a punch (the seafood salad is my favorite), and to their Panang curries. ??I was excited to see that they have a vegetable option for their curries, because I often feel like Thai curries lack adequate veggies. ??Unfortunately, Aroys meat-based curries are still basically veggie-less. ??  I have to dedicate a whole paragraph to their mango with sticky rice, which is the best Thai dessert Ive had anywhere. ??With the exception of one slightly under-ripe mango, every other time weve ordered this, its been luscious and tender and creamy and delicious! ??Theyve also let me know when their mangoes were unusable, so I could change my order to something else (the banana dessert is also tasty). ??I cant believe I can get mango with sticky rice delivered to my door. ??Its like Im living in a crazy awesome dream.  The restaurant is small enough that it can be full on a busy night, so we tend to do delivery or carryout. ??Theres usually plenty of street parking nearby - just dont forget to pay the meter, even if youre just running inside for a minute! College Parks parking enforcement is vicious.

Ok, As always Im hesitant about giving any place 5 stars. But...I think the food here is as good as it gets.  Food: 4.5/5 stars. My friend and I had the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles. My friend said her pad thai was 5 stars! But, to be fair, she really isnt picky about food. My drunken noodles was about as close to 5 stars as Ive ever tasted! YUM! The spice was perfectly balanced with the taste of the food. There were nice big chunks of tomatoes and FRESH basil! The beef was a good portion as well as good size.  The Garden rolls were so-so. The rolls themselves were fine, but I really didnt like the peanut sauce. Which is weird for me because I usually love peanut sauce.  Service: 4.5/5 stars.They kept the water coming and the waitress checked in on us regularly. The food seemed to come a little slow, but we were ok with that. When we were ready to leave, the waitress and the guy at the counter seemed to be busy, but when we went up to pay they were nice and attentive enough.  Decor: 4/5 stars. It was clean, not tacky and no music! I love the fact that there wasnt any music. It was quiet when we first showed up, but even when it was crowded it wasnt loud. I loved it.  Overall, I give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. I really liked this place, enough to give it a 5 star listing. The place is tiny though, so go early to get a seat and dont bring large groups.

So what can I say about Aroy Thai? ??Its excellent. ??If you want flavorful and cheap Thai food, this is the place to go if youre in the College Park area. ??Im sad that Ive just learned about Aroy after years of mediocre Thai.   Based on a few reviews, I got the Pad Phed with beef, and it was amazing. ??I usually opt for some kind of curry, but decided to mix it up. ??Pad Phed tastes a lot (and looks a lot) like curry. ??It was nice and spicy and full of flavor. ??  We also got Tofu Tod (fried tofu with sweet and sour sauce). ??That was okay, but I think with carry out, its difficult to maintain the crispiness. ??The Tom Kha soup was also enjoyable with no ill effects from getting takeout. ??  My wifes staple Thai dish is Tofu drunken noodle. ??That dish was also spectacular with a wonderful smoky flavor and bursting with flavor in each bite.  One interesting thing of note is that delivery (at least on Saturday) does not start until 4:30 PM.   Aroy Thai is now our go-to place for Thai food. ??One of these days we may even sit and eat there!

I recently ordered from here and the food was great. The only problem I had with this place is that the pad see ew I ordered didnt have enough sauce in it which kinda made it a little dry. Still good but none the less, and also they forgot the extra sauce for my Thai chicken wings. That wasnt a big deal just hope its not a regular thing. Overall Ill definitely be ordering from here again.

I placed an order last night (which happened to be a game night on campus) and because there was a large crowd ordering food all at once, delivering took unusually longer. My order arrived approximately an hour and 20 minutes after I had placed the order. But when the food arrived, I was relatively pleased. My favorite was the Beef Pad See Eaw. Omg, it was soo good! The wait definitely was worth it.

This is one of those places that makes you wish you had no clue what good Thai food tasted like (Stang of Siam, Baltimore), because otherwise you would think it was pretty good here.  Its not the worst thai food ever, but it could be much better. The spices just arent on point, and on my most recent trip, my order was messed up (chicken instead of tofu) and the mango and sticky rice was terrible. The mango was not ripe and was incredibly dry, hard to chew. I would rather them just tell me they are out of mango if they cant make this dish properly.  The spices were lacking on the Pad Ka Prow and the drunken noodles are decent, but just not fantastic.   Lunch specials are for dine-in only, which is a real bummer.   In a pinch...

I like their lunch special: $9.95 for an appetizer (either spring rolls or tom yum soup), entree and a drink (includes everything except Thai iced tea, unfortunately). Its reasonably priced, comes out quickly, and though its obviously not the most authentic Thai food, its well done for what it is.   Service is friendly and responsive. I went on a Thursday around 1 and it was still pretty packed.   Their green curry definitely had a kick to it. Their pad thai is a little sweeter than Im used to. Theyre willing to work with you on the spice level, which is nice.

Best Thai food Ive had this side of Bangkok. ??  Ive tasted Thai from many Thai restaurants; I love red curry chicken. This place beats em all. Aroy Thai has apparently been under new ownership for 4 months now. I talked to the owner; she has excellent taste: she told me that when she took over, she tasted everything on the menu and threw out half the items, added new stuff, and fixed up the remaining dishes to make them delicious. The result is the best Thai menu youll find on the East Coast, thats a fact. Dont believe me? Get the red curry chicken. Youll be amazed. Everything on Aroy Thais menu is superb

Definitely my favorite Thai place in the area. You cant go wrong with the chicken pad Thai or the green curry. I should probably try more things on the menu, but Im always so pleased with those two choices. I highly recommend this place.

I ordered green curry???tom yam kung soup and Thai tea, verall they are delicious and fresh, but a little bit too sweet for me.?????????

A very solid dining option near the university of Maryland. ??The dining room is clean and cozy. The staff was super friendly and fast!   The food was a great value for the money. ??The drunken noodles had just the right amount of heat, ??with plenty of chicken and lots of crunchy veggies.   Definitely coming back the next time Im in town.

Went here on Aug. 6 and every dish was so good. Here is what we (a group of 8) ordered and devoured:  Garden roll (the vegetables were fresh and I much prefer this over the fried spring roll) Papaya salad (not a big fan of papaya, but it blended so well with the rest of the vegetables and lime dressing that I went ahead and smashed it) Drunken noodles (couldve eaten the whole thing by myself) Green curry (when mixed with rice, my head almost exploded) Pad see-ew (much fresher than the one served at Tara Thai) Pad broccoli (the chicken was excellent)  The kicker was dessert. I dont normally like my fruits and vegetables fried, but the fried banana was out of this world. And I had never tasted sticky rice before, but I am a huge fan when it is paired with mango.

A diamond in the rough College Park food scene. Conventional Thai that could go toe to toe with any less suburban spot. Great take out, delivery, and a small cute dine-in spot. Definitely not just another UMD d.b. eatery. Really sweet staff. Legit!

love this place, the lunch special would be really a good deal~ live the tom yum soup, spring roll, drunken noodle and pad Thai, really a nice place to try Thai cuisine and most importantly NEAR UMD CAMPUS! The only one disadvantage is the space is too small.... Not many tables inside and the seat really squeeze

I love here!! All dishes on the menu are wonderful! The BEST Thai food in College Park! Try it and u will love here too!

$8.95 lunch special. Includes choice of appetizer (veggie springrolls or soup), an entree with your choice of meat (beef, chicken, or tofu), and a drink (soda, Thai iced tea, or Thai iced coffee).   Great Pad Thai! Friendly service, and a great atmosphere. Also does take out and delivery.

This location has some of the best Thai food that we have had in a long time. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. The food portions plentiful especially for take-out order. ??Everything ( clean tables, atmosphere, food, etc.) about this restaurant put it on my short list of favorite and repeat places to go.

No meal in a Thai restaurant would be complete without ordering a curry dish, or a couple of them. ??On one visit, I ordered the Green Curry. ??My bowl arrived with lean pork, Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, sweet peppers, and purple basil. ??Being a curry dish, the main player is the curry sauce, and this version was outstanding for me. ??It had a slight peppery quality with a vegetal green chili fragrance, made more aromatic with root herbs and the basil. ??But the cooking of the curry paste with fresh tasting coconut milk resulted in a well amalgamated mixture that stands out from other versions. ??It was slightly sweet which points to the Thai sensibility for this seasoning as integral to the authentic palate.    Another visits order of the Red Curry was equally superb with the same ingredients as the above dish with exception of the curry paste. ??The sauce was a bit more fiery with the use of red chilies in the paste with a darker leaf aroma from the use of Kaffir lime leaf - the evidence of a soften leaf points to adequate cooking to render all its flavor into the sauce. ??I was again impressed by the skillful cooking that gave the curry a magical quality that I have not experienced often with this dish  To read rest of review and view photos, check out my blog at Wongeats.

My go-to Thai place in college park. Ive pretty much tried everywhere and this place has always blown everything else out of the water. Cant go wrong with their chicken pad Thai, and the best fried rice Ive had in CP fashoo. Also, this place is family owned and the service here has always been great, whether Im eating in or taking out. Very clean, quaint and friendly!

The food is great the customer service is wonderful. I like that they have samples of each dish sitting in the window for customers to view. A healthy alternative they offer veggie, tofu, shrimp, chicken, pork, and beef to pair with various curries and Thai sauces.  I had the Pad Ka Pow, one of their most popular dishes-stir fried chicken with garlic, basil leaves, onions, and peppers in ??spicy garlic sauce. I also, ordered the Garden Rolls, fried stuffed with cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms served with a sweet and sour sauce. The serving size is enough for one person (like a plentiful serving and a half). Prices range $8.95 a dish. B+ Thai.  They also deliver, but only in the College Park area. The owner is looking to expand the delivery zones in the near future. I have been to a lot of other College Park eateries, where usually the parking is limited or the parking garage is on the back of the building, so you cant get in and out quickly. But, I will say the parking here is easy, usually there are spots right out front.  Glad I walked into this place !

$10 lunch special gets you a meal, soup/friend spring rolls, and a drink. ??I think its an awesome deal. ??I had the drunken noodles with tofu and the noodles were soft, well coated, and plenty of fried crunch tofu available to suck up the rest of the sauce. ??I chose the tom yum soup which to me tasted more like the Vietnamese version (much sweeter-- but I like both versions so it didnt bother me). ??My friend got the green curry with a heaping bowl of rice. ??The said the green curry had some good heat to it. ??The service was very fast and efficient, exactly how I like my asian restaurants. ??The restaurant is quite small, with probably 16 seats over all. ??We came early around 11;45 during lunch before the rest of the crowd came. ??I cant imagine how pack id be during the school year.

I was a bit wary about Aroy Thai replacing Yami-Yami (where am I going to get bibimbap now?), especially since I am a frequent visitor of Pho Thom when I want walking-distance pad thai. But, it was my friends graduation, so I treated him to lunch here and found myself liking the joint. ALSO THEY DELIVER so I can eat pad thai without even leaving campus. SCORE.  The lunch special is a really good deal. For $8.95, you get an appetizer, entree, and drink (they specify which you can get). I got the crispy spring roll, pad thai, and Thai iced tea. The spring rolls were REAL hot, which was nice but did catch me by surprise! It was good, considering the day was a bit dreary. Pad thai was good, Thai iced tea was good. I have no real complaints about this place. Food came out after a short wait and did its job. I brought back my pad thai to finish later and it was just as good reheated.  I think the lunch special is definitely a SUPER good deal, PLUS the fact that this is a Thai option that delivers is a mega bonus (they are on GrubHub).

I heart this place.   A tiny nook with amazing food. ??We often go in or get take out. ??Its so delicious and the family-run business is aways filled with cheerful staff.   This is one of my places to get comfort food--it feels like family and is as delicious as home cooked food :)

Ive ate at a lot of Thai restaurants and I must say this place easily placed in top three. Even though its in a small place the food packs a big punch of a five star restaurant. Their drunken noodles are great, this place actually makes it correct, very spicy if you want it to be. I also got the fried rice, very yummy. In conclusion if you like spicy Thai food, real spicy Thai food, buy it from here. And also they deliver which is awesome, price is fair. And menu is quite large.

Do not eat here. Customer service is awful! The woman who served us was so rude. Ordered the thai chicken wings which were dry and burnt, the papaya salad was spicy which threw me off because its usually not at other Thai restaurants. The penang curry was good however the side of rice was extremely small. Overall I was not impressed with their food or service. Nice location though, very accessible from UMD.

4 stars for the food but 4.5 stars for service  Honestly not many have heard of this place. It used be a sushi place called Yami Yami but is now small family-run restaruant, located near Papa Johns on College Ave. Theres limited seating, so I recommend coming with a group of around 4-5 people at most. The pad thai dishes are around $9-10, which is a decent price given the servings. However, what I really enjoy about this place is the service. All the times Ive been here, I have received such great service. The owners wife is really such a sweet lady, always making sure everyone is properly served. A friend and I once walked in at 10pm and although you could tell they were planning on closing soon, they still served us patiently. Dinner rush is usually around 6-7pm, so be wary of waiting times (small restaurant w/ limited seating).  While I love coming here, I find that the food is always a bit too oily for me. However, the spices and flavoring are better than any other Thai/Viet places in the area and they give good servings. Definitely one of the better places to go to for dinner if youre around campus.

Good reviews can be misleading and I was lead astray.  Waited almost an hour for our food. Waiter doesnt pay attention to you, its hard to get her attention, no check ups.   Food: Pad thai was comparable to that of Noodles &amp; Company, except Noodles &amp; Company actually gave me more than Aroys too much noodles, too little meat. The fact that its flavors compares to Noodles &amp; Company just means it was bad thai food...  Not sure why this place has such a high rating for bland food and bad service.

We went here because all the other places on Rt. 1 were closed due to some technical difficulties  The price for the lunch combo is decent. 8.95 for a drink, soup/roll, main course.   Everyone else got the vegetarian roll (fried spring rolls). I got the tom yum soup. The spring rolls tasted fine but were soaked with oil, they did not seem like they were made in house. The tom yum soup was probably the worst tom yum that I have ever had, it arrived cold, had raw mushrooms and tomato in it, the chicken tasted off, and it had no flavor. The fact that it arrived cold, after a neighboring table sent back their soup for being cold shows that they really dont care much about the product quality.  For the main course I had the Ka Pow beef. The meat could have been higher quality, but that was not my biggest complaint with the dish. The real problem was that it was over salted to the point of being inedible, and I have a heavy hand when it comes to salt so I am accustomed to a lot of salt. But even for me it was way too much.   The thai iced tea, which is usually lovely (at other places), was way too sweet here. It tasted like it had sugar and artificial sweeteners combined. To me it was undrinkable.  Im not sure why this place gets such rave reviews, pretty much everything that I tasted could have been significantly better. Needless to say, I will not be returning here.

This is an excellent Thai restaurant by any standard. ??Have I had better Thai? - Yes. But when Im craving Thai, I go here, because this place is reasonably priced and has all the classic Thai dishes - plus Crispy Banana. ??Mmm Crispy Banana.... ??Ive never been disappointed with my order.   However, my one complaint is that they never give you enough rice. ??Always order extra rice with your curry. ??The rice the give you is only enough for half of the serving size of curry. And you may have to order more Peanut and Sweet &amp; Spicy sauces. They dont give you enough of side sauces either.  But, damn the curry is good! ??I wish they had Cellophane Noodle Salad, but they dont.  So if your in the area, dont go to Tara Thai - The McDonalds of Thai Food - check this place out instead. ??Its tiny inside with only 5 or 6 tables. ??Its probably better suited for carryout. ??But the Thai food is legit and not just also on the menu of a pho restaurant.   I hope the College Students recognize quality food, and support this authentic Thai Restaurant. ??Because, I want to see it to last for years to come, in this transient college town.  Me Likey!..  BTW: Aroy Thai opened in the old Yami Yami bubble tea spot on College ave. ??This storefront has been so many different things over the years.

Get the Pad Thai or Panang Curry. The peanut sauce and spices work great together, and both dishes will fill you up for lunch. Then you can reheat them for dinner too.   The service is good in the restaurant. The bathroom is far back past the kitchen, which is an odd experience.   The delivery time is among the longest in the town.   The prices are about double what youll pay for other Asian food or the generic college food elsewhere in the town.   Its worth it, because the food is very good. Unique, at least to my palate, too.  Could be spicier though.

I went here for late lunch with a friend when they newly opened and the place was tight but clean. The foods &amp; prices were great!

I usually get the drunken noodles and the mango sticky rice. ??Ive tried the thai tea and coffee but didnt like either one.  I do like the small and cozy atmosphere and will be coming back!

Believe the hype! This place is really really good!  I ordered the Drunken noodle and Thai ice tea. It was delicious! I will definitely come back again.

Im a big fan of Thai food, and the panang curry here is so yummy, especially for the price. Its my favorite dish and they do it pretty well. Everything else I have ever gotten here has been delicious. Definitely go here if youre looking for somewhere with quality food in a college town  (Also: really fast carry out! I order take out all the time and its ready in like 15 min usually)

The delivery order took an hour and a half and the food was TERRIBLE!! Borderline inedible--even something as simple as satay was bland and disgusting. I just ordered Americanized chinese and it was better than this. Save your time and money and move on to the next place.  Update: one of the items was spiced to the point of inedibility. I called to request my money back and the hostess hung up on me twice; she said Im sorry but we are very busy and my driver is not back yet for me to see the order youre talking about I then asked for the manager and she hung up on me.

I love this place! Theres not many good asian food places in College Park but Aroy Thai is one of my favorites. Their Pad Thai is better than anyone elses in the area. Their curries are also very good. Service is always friendly, but its a tiny bit on the expensive side for a college town.

Their service was pretty slow and shaky the first time I dined here, so I usually just order to go, but today the service was perfect. I came with a group of friends who hadnt been here before, and by the end of the meal they all said that would definitely come back more often.   I decided to try the pad spaghetti instead of my usual fried rice (which is fantastic by the way) and Im really glad I did. It had all the great flavors of pad kee mao and the spaghetti was a nice variation from rice noodles.   The only issue that came up was with my friends food. She ordered one of the beef soups, thinking that it wasnt spicy at all, but it actually ended up being too spicy for her to eat. We all taste-tested the broth to see if it was as spicy as she claimed. As a spicy-food lover, I didnt think it was spicy at all, but another friend said it was kind of spicy at first, so we just left it at that. In any case, if you know you cant handle spicy food and you still want to eat Thai food, it might be a good idea to double check before ordering in case an item that should have a star on the menu doesnt actually have one.  Service was great overall. The lady who works here is SO sweet. I know Asian restaurants dont always have the best rep in terms of service, but seriously she is fantastic. She separated our checks without us even asking (some people might not like this, but we thought it was very helpful) and gave us delicious fruit candy before we left. You just cant help but smile when you come here! And that alone is what keeps me coming back.

Just ok. I ordered the sweet and spicy wings and the seafood pad thai. The wings were flavorful but pad thai was extremely dry. It was also limited in seafood: 3 shrimps, 2 pieces of calamari, ??2 baby scallops and 2 oysters.

I love this little Thai restaurant!! It is very small, only a few tables and on a quiet narrow street across UMDCP campus. But food there is very authentic and of good price and FRESH INGREDIENTS!  For appetizer, ??I ordered fish cake. It is a bit greasy, but tastes nice with special source (peanut butter sauce on top). For salad, I love Larb Gai and its very authentic Thai style and flavor. It is a bit spicy but tolerable. If you are a big fan for extreme spicy stuff, try the papaya salad. Otherwise, get away from it! I love stir fries in general. The Eggplant with beef (and make sure you add extra tofu with it if you are a fan of tofu!!!), you will be so impressed with by the fresh and full flavor! I also love the stir fry with string beans, or garlic sauce as well. I tried Pannang curry as well, personally not a big fan of its. I will go back to this place again and again!

I would give 4 stars for red curry beef, but 2 stars for Tom Yum soup. So 3 stars on average. The chicken in the soup is overcooked. Its not tender, but chewy. I suggest using shrimp instead.

This is my favorite restaurant in College Park, and one of the best Thai restaurants Ive ever been to. I usually get their drunken noodles with beef, thai tea, and mango sticky rice.  Their drunken noodles are the best Ive ever had. The portions are really generous, and the dish itself is very flavorful. Its a little spicy, but Im sure you can ask them to adjust that if spicys not your thing. The penang curry is really delicious too, although I get that less often. My friends have ordered an array of other things as well, all delicious.  The thai tea here is really good. I dont know why, but it just tastes better than the thai tea Ive had at other places.   The mango sticky rice is just amazing. I usually dont do desserts, but I order this every time I come. The other dessert they offer is fried bananas with honey, which the lady convinced me to try last year during restaurant week. Its also really good, and Ill sometimes order it in addition to the mango sticky rice.  The lady who works here is super sweet! Service is always good, although sometimes wait times can get crazy. Theyll always let you know beforehand though.

Our first trip there, we found the food delicious and the service pleasant. ??The dining area is tiny, but only half full on a Sunday evening. ??We had Penang and Massaman curries, plus Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. ??Based on our experience, we definitely plan to return soon.  Very good value for the money and a pleasant atmosphere.

This place is great! I normally get the pad see ew with tofu or chicken. Sometimes, Ill get the Thai chicken wings as an appetizer. The place is great for take-out. Ive tried many Thai places around DC and hands-down they have the best pad see ew.   I also really appreciate the staff - super friendly and they remember what you like if youre a repeat customer.   The prices went up since the spring, but I get it - its a small operation and food costs go up from time to time.  Great place, check it out!

Seriously one of the best Thai places in the area, Im shocked that it isnt always packed. The drunken noodle and red curry are my goto dishes. Awesome food and friendly staff!

Excellent! ??Small and cozy location on UMCP campus. ??Parking is a pain, but the food is great. ??Great lunch specials. ??  Not a great deal of seating, FYI.

Most of all the entress Ive had here Ive liked - penang curry, pad see ew, drunken noodles, etc. Their noodley items are pretty good, I just like asking for extra sauce because sometimes its a bit dryer than I prefer. Curry puffs were surprisingly good, inside is more of a mash with the potatos than the normal ground meat/potato combination, and I like their Thai tea and sticky rice/mango also, but its hard to get those wrong. Also, pretty amazing to be able to find this good food on Rt. 1 in College Park. Id say this is probably one of your best options for food around this area.

Some of the best num tok Ive had in a long time. ??Also the pad ka pow, drunken noodle, and massaman curry were excellent. Well be back.

This is such a college park gem. Every dish here is delicious. Their pad thai is consistently great. Other standouts include Pad Cashew Nut, and especially their Panang Curry. The Panang Curry is to die for. Absolutely a must-try. Dining in or taking out, the staff is friendly and they know how to do thai food justice, especially in a college town.

This place is not good. ??Do yourself a favor and never eat here. ??Ive given this place 3 chances to impress me and its been bad every single time. ??  This place is essentially the thai version of that nasty chinese take out joint you see on every corner of the inner city neighborhoods that also sometimes sells pizza and wings. ??Except those places are good at what they do.  #1) The service is bad and aloof. ??First time we sat down to eat in and were mostly ignored and waited a long time for at best so/so food. ??The thai iced tea was way too sweet, and the food was bland and poorly cooked but not horrible...fast forward to:  #2) Second time we had the food here we ordered drunken noodles (my personal fav) and panang curry. ??The drunken noodles were a joke. ??They were overcooked, the noodles didnt have the right texture, the sauce was bad and kind of grey, and the only vegetables in the disk where quartered bland tomatoes. ??No garnish, no spice, and the overall dish was completely devoid of flavor. ??The most bland food Ive eaten in a while. ??Oh and to top things off, I ordered mine with shrimp and the shrimp were horrible. ??They had that tell-tale sign of being rotten from the black tail fins, had a mealy texture and wreaked of ammonia and fishiness. ??I threw all of the shrimp out with one bite. ??I was pissed.  #3) So my girlfriend just went there today with some co-workers for lunch and offered to bring me home some lunch as well. ??That certainly perked me up after a tough week. ??SO I decided to try their pad thai. ??I mean, a thai restaurant should be proud of their pad thai, its such a common traditional dish full of exciting flavors and textures. ??Well, first off, she got told by the staff that the lunch specials cant be ordered to-go. ??So thats shitty and without any logical reasoning. ??So i said, fine, get the entree and get it with shrimp. ??She came home with a big box of food that was a bland, horrible excuse for pad thai. ??The other negative reviews on here say that its akin to Noodles and Companys Pad Thai. ??I have to disagree, its worse, much worse. ??The sauce is obviously some sort of commercial grade pre-made sauce they just add to low quality flat rice noodles. ??For some unknown reason they put little pieces of cured pork into the dish, which was off-putting. ??It was bland, you could barely make out the sour flavor of tamarind, no lime flavor, no herbs, the peanut and sprouts garnish were minimal, and to top it all off, it seems they were pulling the same nonsense with the shrimp. ??Its obvious to me that they buy the cheapest, lowest quality shrimp they can find and they let it sit around way too long. ??  Its obvious to me that this restaurant is just phoning in the job of making good thai food. ??The cooks (Im sure its not a chef) are lazy and presenting the dumbed down version of thai food. ??Its overpriced, shitty thai food without a care for the culinary delight that can be thai cuisine. ??  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!

Amazing food and great service. I always get the Pad Pak Ruam (not spicy but delicious), but I have had some other dishes. Most places around here say spicy but dont mean it- they definitely mean it here. I havent had anything bad here yet. I have had it delivered, and the delivery person is always super sweet... and Ive eaten in the restaurant with a sweetheart of a waitress. The only reason for the 4 stars is that sometimes I dont think there is enough food for the price (or maybe its my greedy stomach). When I eat in the restaurant there is more food than I can handle, but the delivery always seems less. Either way, it doesnt stop me from making this a Sunday night meal every week. Also, the lunch buffet is totally worth it-- I can never finish my meal and its only 9.95 for an appetizer, meal, and drink! The only problem is that its so good that its packed at lunch time and theres not a lot of seating.   I definitely recommend trying this place out ASAP.

Consistently tasty food and ??good service. This is by far the best Thai option in the College Park area. Ive eaten here every month or so for a couple of years, and have never been disappointed. They are a bit pricey (usually about 12$ for a dinner entree) compared to their less tasty peers.

Awesome food! The panang curry is ridiculously good and the family that owns the restaurant is friendly and warm. College Park really lucked up when this place opened!

In a corner of college park downtown, lies a very cute, cosy, nice Thai restaurant, i.e., Aroy Thai!  Intended to go to Wasabi for some Sushi, but chanced upon Aroy Thai because of parking infront of it.  The menu looked good so decided to go inside. I ordered the Thai chicken wings for starters and Thai chicken red curry for myself and Thai chicken noodle soup for my friend.  The Thai chicken wings werent anything exceptional and neither will I try again. However, I loved the Thai red curry! It was sweet and spicy and with good flavors. My friend liked the noodle soup too, saying it had nice flavor of lemongrass and also looked healthy to me!  The manager was very sweet, who was conversant till we left, considering it was the closing time.  Its a really nice place and I would recommend everyone to give it a try :)  Besides, I loved the candy she gives in the end. Some guava flavored candy. Lol.  Kudos to the sweet manager :)

My go-to place for Thai delivery. Tastes better (and a lot cheaper) than the Tara Thai down the road. My favorites are the Kapow (which is one of my favorite dishes anywhere) and the Kee Mao Fried Rice. Nice and spicy.  I have never dined in, so I cannot comment on that, but the delivery is great!

Seriously, Aroy Thai thank you for bringing some pretty banging Thai food in the College Park area! Its small, comfortable, and bonus points with their hip orange walls. I remember when I first stopped by, and this lady who I believe was also owner, greeted me when I walked in and made the whole experience enjoyable and personable.  This restaurant replaces the beloved Yami Yami (which I loved), but the mourning and bitterness of its lost was short lived when I tried some of their Pad See Ew. Yes, Ive only tried their Pad see Ew and Drunken Noodles so far, but they were both delicious and there was more than enough for leftovers.  Overall, its a pretty solid place for UMD students to get that Thai food fix. Im definitely a fan, and will go to this restaurant whenever Im in the area and craving Thai food.   Some quick tips: The lunch special is 11-3pm, but its only for dine-in.  Bring some change for the parking meter.  There are only a couple tables, but all-around a cozy, hip restaurant.

The presentation of the plates have been pretty good (especially for the spring rolls, so cool) and the desserts are fantastic.

This is an adorable family owned restaurant. The pad thai here is amazing. Its really authentic and the portion is huge. The food came out fast and the service is very prompt.

Long delivery wait times and rude staff have forced me to update this review. The chicken wings now arrive like warm and rubbery from sitting in a car. The spring rolls are soggy, from the condensation of the styrofoam.

This is an authentic Thai Restaurant. I finally found food that reminds me of my home-cooked Thai meals at home with beautiful presentation and delicious flavors! I recommend the Pad Ka Pow, egg rolls, Thai Iced Tea, and Mango sticky rice! The restaurant is a small space, but very cute and homey inside. The prices are extremely reasonable for the portion sizes you get and the lunch special is a DEAL.

If I couldve marked ZERO thats what I wouldve given this place since that is exactly what I got ZERO service. I read the reviews and decided to go here....only to park the car and of course have to pay a meter for 1 hour worth of time...to get out the car walk up to the place and see lights off darkness...looked at my watch oh its 12:07pm ok maybe they are running a little behind. So I wait a few minutes and see a lady walking by she looks at the window can see us standing there and proceeds to walk off doing whatever she was doing cuz obviously opening the business wasnt a priority at that time....so I called the number listed on the door and of course NO ONE answers the phone. Annoyed at this point we make our exit and proceed to another restaurant only to see I have a missed called from guess who? Aroy Thai Restaurant. Dont know why you calling me when you didnt acknowledge me while Im physically standing outside your restaurant lol needless to say I wont ever be going back here.

My friend and I ordered the fried rice and red curry. Highly recommended! Especially the fried rice, very tasteful. I ordered online for pick up and it took around 25-30 minutes. The price is a little pricier than whats around, about $10 a piece but was worth it.

Their food is pretty good, and not too greasy. The portions are kinda small compared to other restaurants, but it is plenty for one meal. They use fresh vegetables, which is nice. Ive never dined in, the dining room is small, basically just some tables in front of a take-out counter (no ambiance).

My first Thai restaurant in MD...ugh...I try and not be to overcritical with a takeout review...but other than the pleasant staff...Im at a loss to explain my food...There is an Aroy Thai in the St Louis metro area that I have gotten take out from and there is NO comparison...they make the drunken noodles with W-I-D-E flat noodles and they were so overcooked it killed anything that could have been good about it...and asked for medium spicy and got 9/10 spicy (not cool) also ordered Pad Thai and I have to agree with another reviewer in saying it tasted like something from Noodles &amp; Co just bland and oddly with a pile of peanut dust I still couldnt taste the peanut...anyway on to the next Thai rest...unlikely with so many other choices to try, that I will return...

Bland and boring. ??I cant fathom how this place has 4 stars. ??Questionable food and 1.5 hours to get it here. ??No thanks.

Pad Thai was good, though very very spicy didnt result in spicy. ??However, adding a little spice at home made this the best Ive had so far in the DC area.  The place is tiny, so I suggest takeout. ??Further, I suggest calling ahead. ??Given the time it took them, they make everything to order, and it tasted like it, too.

Went here with my girlfriend, and we both just loved it! Attentive service, yummy food, and plenty of water. I got the chicken pad thai, and she got something else. It doesnt matter what she ordered, because it tasted really good! We highly recommend eating here.

A great Thai Restaurant in downtown College Park?! ??Heck yes!  Ive been walking by this place every day on my way to campus and finally dropped by to get carryout today (actually, I tried once before, but it was on a Sunday and they are closed on Sundays). ??Its on College Ave, three storefronts down from The Bagel Place and next door to Wasabi Sushi. ??  They have the usual noodles and curries and a number of other Thai entrees that I am unfamiliar with. ??I got red curry with beef, pad thai with chicken, crispy spring rolls and mango sticky rice. ??It was all great. ??The spring rolls were crisp-fried but not greasy, perfect. ??The red curry was listed as very spicy but I was able to handle it - if you really love spice you might want to add some chili sauce or request it made extra spicy. ??The beef was very tender, the sauce savory and filling. ??The Pad Thai was mild but delicious, and the portion was large. ??All of their curries and noodles can be ordered with tofu or vegetarian if you dont eat meat. ??The mango sticky rice was something new to me - the rice was sweet and so sticky it was almost chewy (by design) and the mango (they give you an entire half mango!) was fresh and delicious. ??  The prices are good. ??I got 2 entrees appetizer and dessert for $26 - it was plenty to feed two very hungry people. ??I even forgot my coupon and they still gave me the discount - thanks guys! ??I promise I wont forget next time... ??:)  tl;dr - the food is solid - fresh, tasty, and not greasy, the space is clean, the staff are friendly, and the prices are good!

Mediocre food and rude delivery service. The driver simply couldnt be inconvenienced to enter my apartment building. Delivery does not mean, Ill meet you in the parking lot.

The pad thai and drunken noodles were good. They were flavorful and delivered hot. (Delivery through GrubHub.)  The food was better than Tara Thai and cheaper too. Go here instead.

Aroy Thai is above the average Thai restaurant. They have so many options on the menu and its a great place for vegetarians/vegans. The people that work/own the place are really friendly and I have always had quick service. I really love the Pad Prew Whan too.

The place is cute and the lady at the front was helpful. ??Unfortunately I was less than impressed with my food. I got the shrimp panang and this $15 entr??e was basically a bowl full of sauce with 2 huge pieces of carrot, 3 potato bits and 5 medium sized shrimp and although I could taste the spices in it, it still lacked authenticity. ??A complete rip off. ??sucky part is that I ordered my food to go, so I didnt see this catastrophe until I got home. Unless I definitely would have sent my order back for something else.

I like this place except that they could have provided more portion of food. For me, the dinner portion is only good enough for lunch. But the food is delicious and the waitress keeps checking up.

The food is excellent! The portions are just right, and for the price the food is quality and the flavors are so so yummy! I love spicy food and their food has a perfect balance of heat while still maintaining the flavor! I had the drunken noodles and I would definitely recommend it.   So happy a Thai place opened up here in CP. I used to go to Tara Thai in Hyattsville to get my Thai food fix but this place has surpassed them in tastiness! (and the portions are just too small at Tara Thai)   I will definitely be going back to try the entire menu!

Beware the following: the fried chicken wings. I love them, but every time a few of them are undercooked, as their is blood when you get near the bone. Still ate em, but just be forewarned....

I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken, Pad Thai with Shrimp and the Thai Tea.   Um. Yea I was famish.   When I normally order curry I have the same expectations. A decent bowl of white rice and a soup to chicken ratio of 1 part chicken to two parts soup. I like my protein, so it was always something I thought I would have to get over. But no lie. Chicken curry was bombdiggity. Does that word make me uncool? Well sorry guys but Im honest and I have to say I love the curry. LOTS of chicken. Made me a happy asian.   The pad thai was thankfully not dry and had a good amount of shrimp. How many times have you shrimp to noodle portions been off when you eat at restaurants? So major plus here.   Thank you for not skimping out on the good stuff!!!  Thai tea was in a good size cup and it was sweet. Although it is a bit sweeter than what I am use to the servers who helped me, understood and fixed it accordingly.   If something isnt to your taste, why do you choose to sit there and eat or drink something you dont fully enjoy? Youre paying either way, make it worth your hard earned money.   Food can almost always be redone/replaced, you just have to tell your servers. Service is the main reason I would take away stars.   Service was definitely on point for this small hole in the wall so the verdict here is FIVE STARS. Food is good, service is good and fast~ Definitely will be back.

Came in with family while visiting UMD. Not bad! Nothing super special but they did take excellent care of us and the waiter was cute! All in all we enjoyed but it wasnt anything unique.

I decided to give this place a try since it had decent reviews. I ordered the shrimp pad thai, spring rolls and mango sticky rice. My order took 1 1/2 hours to arrive, however, the manager did call to inform me the meal would be late and my driver apologized for the delay.   The food itself was decent but not amazing. Ive had worse Thai food and much better Thai food. Overall, if you are willing to spend $20 on average Thai food this isnt a bad place to try. If you are looking for something genuinely fantastic then keep looking.

One of the worst drunken noodles Ive ever had. ??I only tried this place because Kao Thai was closed for renovations and I was craving for drunken noodles. ??The chicken wings arent even worth the price. Total waste of my time and money. Idk how anyone can rate this high as a great place to eat drunken noodles.

Pretty good for College Park. I feel like I always compare College Park as if its a random island or something... But thats because nothing but crap or chains is usually in College Park! Anyway, Aroy Thai is probably one of the better places to get Thai food around here (that and Pho Thom). Ive gotten Aroy Thais drunken noodles for take out and the portion size was large and not pricey at all (standard - I think about $8-9). Parking sucks but doesnt it always suck in College Park? I say suck as in you have to pay for meters. There is street parking with meters right in front or you can park across Route 1 where Chipotle, Jasons Deli, Bank of America, etc. are.

Probably one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the College Park area. Food is delicious and the portions are decently sized

Awesome!!! Everything Ive had has been delicious. Curry, Pad Thai, Soup, Thai Ice Tea, the banana dessert... everything has been good. And the rice is really good, its cooked perfectly. Also the prices are reasonable for the amount you get. Try the lunch special, its a good deal.

We went here for dinner after my younger brothers graduation. ??I was impressed. ??I ordered the eggplant chili garlic dish (dont remember the exact menu name now), and it was delicious. ??This is my go-to Thai dish, so Ive had it at many establishments, and this place did it very well. ??It was a bit on the spicy side for me, because you dont get a choice in how spicy the dish is made. ??The Pad See Ewe (which my sister ordered) was pretty amazing. ??The noodle texture was nice, with a little bit of chewiness. ??Plus it was quite flavorful. ??  My only complaint is that they served a very small amount of rice with the rice dishes (like the eggplant, and the green curry). ??It wasnt enough rice. ??It would also be nice to be able to choose your own spiciness level (so, maybe 1.5 complaints).   The staff was very friendly and accommodating, helping get settled with a baby in tow. ??I would definitely go back if in College Park. ??It was tasty food for a good value.

Took 2 hours for my delivery to come. Pad Thai was the worst Ive had. Sticky rice was good though.

Normally, I LOVE Aroy Thai , the food is delicious and the delivery time is usually short. HOWEVER...tonight I ordered my food at 7:25p.m. to be delivered to my dorm. It is now 9:30p.m. and I still havent received my order. I love the food here, but I cannot wait 2 hours to eat. It is a shame the service is so slow.

Excellent Thai food in College Park in a cozy setting with friendly service. ??Had pad eggplant which was delicious...I would go back the next time I am in the area.

This place is legitimately awful. Grabbed dinner here while we were in town for a conference - the service was slow, the portions were tiny, and the food was mediocre at best. I have no idea why this place has four stars.

Was in town for a brief meeting and it was suggested we try Aroy. Very, very authentic and delicious. In fact, one of our party is Thai and even she was impressed. The place is tiny with few tables but thats not an issue. The feel is of a larger restaurant with excellent service, fresh and marvelously prepared and presented food, great Thai iced tea and incredible desserts. I enjoyed everything I ate. I only wish I lived nearby so I could become a regular.

I really liked the management, service, and functionally decorated space; I really wanted to love the food but there were some issues. I got drunken noodles, which were average tastiness and fairly oily. It was a very generous portion for the price. My husband got the Pa Ka Pow (I think, it was one of the plastic entrees in the window). He likes his food spicy, and usually thai restaurants bring the heat, but it wasnt even spicy at all! Pretty disappointing. Also, his portion was TINY. It was bizarre how much smaller his meal was than mine, and it was more expensive! He ended up eating the other half of my meal to compensate. They are new and just getting started, I might check back in in 6 months or so to see if things improve, but for now Ill stick to Siris (or venture into DC) for Thai.

The list of good and interesting restaurants on the Rte 1/UMD strip isnt very big, but Im hopeful that it just got expanded by 1. ??This place just opened up in the spot where Yami Yami used to be. I had the drunken noodles w/ tofu and their tom yum soup. Both were delicious. This looks like a real effort, and not a what swill can we sell college students? kind of thing. Ill definitely be back.

This was my first time at this restaurant. ??There are two four tops and three two tops so it is a small place. ??My favorite dish Thai dish is panang so I use it as my benchmark. ??They have lunch specials that include a veggie spring roll or tom tum and a drink (a selection).  I ordered chicken panang with tom yum chicken and a Thai iced tea. ??I was blown away. ??The ingredients were fresh and the taste of the food was spot on. ??I will be coming back again!

I was a little skeptical about trying this place, but once I tried I couldnt stop. It was absolutely delicious. The Drunken noodles and panang curry was very flavorful. The papaya salad was delicious and very spicy too. Overall I would give this place 5/5. The food is very authentic, and definitely one of the better thai restaurants around the area, and budget friendly too!

Took way too long. Some food (curry shrimp) was awesome and sticky mango rice excellent. But chicken wings were horrible. I love Thai food but may have to find something better.

Went back and the food was much better, but the service is terrible. Expect to wait a while for your food, even if youre the only ones there, and forget about prompt refills.

Worth a try. ??The Pad Thai was wonderful, and the very spicy was indeed very spicy. ??Ill stop by again when in CP.

Hint: Order take out. Service is very slow, although staff are very accommodating and quite nice. Ordered panang curry chicken. Chicken was a bit dry, and it did not have much heat. My wife ordered a green curry chicken, which she said was very good. The teens ordered pad Thai type dishes, which were good. For appetizers (yes, I know I am writing backwards, but I am rewinding in my head), we ordered vegetable spring rolls and larb gai. Both were good, though the larb gai was supposed to be very spicy, and I would call it medium. Prices are very good, and portions are just the right size. Flavors just dont pop and offer the same delicious excitement of the best Thai restaurants Ive been to, but it is good, especially given it is across the street from 30,000 less than discerning college students!

Amazing food and great service. One of those finds youll keep going back to - it is simple but good. It is BYOB and small so expect to wait for a table on weekend nights. No waiting room inside and all on street parking.

Was in the area with my fianc?? and decided to check out this place after reading the reviews. So glad we did! I ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken and the Beef Salad. Definitely a 5! The flavor and level of spiciness was just right. My fianc?? ordered the Pad Ka Pow with shrimp. He said it was the best ka pow he has ever had. My only complaint would be that the portions could be a little bigger. ??But definitely worth the trip to College Park and you cant beat the price. The cheapest ??and most delicious dinner we have had in a long time!

I seldom try any of the new restaurants in downtown College Park since they are geared toward the students palate. ??However, my husband and I cannot resist Thai food so ventured to this new eating establishment which is a gem. Hoping for the best, we ordered panang chicken curry and basil chicken. ??We were both pleased with our selections. My curry had an artful presentation, and after the first bite, I was sold. ??Tangy yet smooth, it was the perfect pick me up after a hard week. ??I am giving only four stars because the place has little ambience despite the owners attempts to decorate on a budget. ??That will not stop me though from going back again and again.

got carryout here for the first time today and was impressed.... good thing it was carryout, as the inside dining area is tiny. ??No skimping on ingredients here, plenty of meat, vegetables, and flavor in everything. ??As with most Asian restaurants, if you want HOT, say Asian hot, not white people hot

A nice little restaurant, only 7 or 9 tables, so unless you get lucky lunch at high noon on a weekday it might be tough, but the lunch special runs from 11:30 to 3 PM. I went while the university was on Spring Break, and enjoyed the lunch special. The Drunken Noodles were great! If you like Thai give it a try.

This is our go to place for take out: fresh and tasty cashew-chicken, hot curry, satay. Real comfort food. I only wish theyd make the rice containers a bit bigger, we always have to order an extra portion of rice or noodles.

Im a fan of the noodle dishes, too. And, the mango with sticky rice has nicely ripe fruit and a good amount of sweetness.

food is priced right especially during lunch!   Ive only gone to their lunch special (3 times). Lunch special is delicious and for a good price! You get a choice of a entree, drink , and appetizer. I usually get chicken pad thai, thai ice tea, and spring roll (2 nice and crispy) for around $8! They give you a large portion of Pad Thai and I always end up packing it/eating it for dinner later. ??  Im so glad they came to college park! I was getting sick of eating all the other Chinese and sushi restaurants. ??Aroy Thai is something different and unique!

Ive been here twice. ??The first time was in October 2012, and ??I enjoyed an excellent shrimp red curry--5 stars. ??I returned again in early December, and had Pad Phed, which was grossly oversalted and not worth one star. ??Ill be very wary should I visit again.

Best Thai food in College Park, my friend and I have been there several times, the food is really tasty.
