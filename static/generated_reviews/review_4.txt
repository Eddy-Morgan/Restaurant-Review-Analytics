Enjoyied breakfast with my daughter before we went to the museum. The service was swift, the staff was attentive, and the food was great!  When visiting my daughter to check on her, we stopped here for food as she had to a nearby store. The French toast was good, the bacon was crisp, and she said she loved the sausage. I was impressed by the quick service. ??We were seated within 5 minutes &amp; our was quickly taken.  If you are pressed for time, in a hurry, and want good food... this is your place to go. If Im in the area again, would definitely stop by for a bite. Trust me, you wont be disappointed with the food or service.

Ugggghhh. So bad!!! Or as my girlfriend said: Disgusting!!! They should call it Awful House.  A few examples of how this place fails miserably: Hash browns were drowning in oil, toast was served with margarine on the side and not butter (Ive never ever had this happen anywhere -- gross), coffee was terrible, and I asked for my eggs over medium and they were served completely over easy.  Just terrible. Worse than IHOP or Dennys.

Probably the worst food ever. ??I ordered the Hot Roast Beef plate. ??There was very little roast beef, maybe two slices, three slices of bread, and tons of cold gelatinous gravy. The roast beef was well done, which is not a good thing. ??Finally the entire dish was cold. ??It is called the Hot Roast Beef! ??The mashed potatoes were also cold.  The only good thing was that the server was very nice. ??However, my personal feeling is that a restaurant cannot get any merit for nice personal or servers if the food is just bad.

This is my second time here at this location. I came to eat breakfast with a friend, but the servers or at least our server was not very attentive even though there were not many people in the diner. I wanted to get hot sauce but the waitress never even looked my way so I just ate my food without the sauce. The food is average... the western omelette only tasted like onions and the meat was scarce. Would not be coming back for breakfast at this location.

It took literally an hour to get my food after it was sitting in front of another customer and I watched the open it and touch it. I asked about it and they just bagged it and gave it to me. I dont know if it was just the night shift or what but I wont go here anymore. I still left a tip tho because Im a nice guy

Classic greased spoon diner with cheap prices and good food. Place was a dirty too, but not in the classic diner way. Menu was s bit small for the average diner with a few breakfast options, subs and dinners.  The meatloaf is the best thing about the place. Gotta try it!!!

What I like most: + College Park Burger with cheese + Great omelettes + Accepts credit cards + Friendly staff + Conveniently located near three hotels  Opportunities to develop: - Milkshake machine could be repaired - Recommend arriving early for lunch because all seats were taken when I got there. .

I had such high hopes for this place based on the reviews and the rating. The diner I normally frequent is temporarily closed and I wanted pancakes so I tried this one!  We had to ask for silverware because we werent given any and the pancakes tasted like they were the pre-made frozen kind from the grocery store. Like seriously, how do you make nasty pancakes? Our server was great and swapped them out for another menu item which is why I gave the two stars but the other works have attitudes upon interacting with them, service was slow even when it wasnt busy when we first arrived, and it just didnt live up to the hype at all.   Probably wont be back.

If Im in College Park, then you will find me at the College Park Diner for breakfast. I dont say that tongue and cheek, this is truth. The hotel may provide breakfast, but it is bypassed in lieu of this quaint little breakfast/lunch spot that is an institution in the area.  So what do you need to know? Parking is a nightmare when busy on weekends. There is little of it in there small lot, but the good news is spots turn over quickly. Look all around the building before giving up and if you still cant find anything branch out to the business to your right. Its a big lot that is empty on weekends. No signs that say they will ticket, or tow.  My experience is all weekend which is there crazy, insane time. When you see a line dont get too concerned. Yes the place is small, but the turn over is swift in guest. Go to the cash register and put your name on their list immediately. You can split up if you wish since they have a counter.  The interior is old and dated, dont expect fancy whatsoever. This is a dive of sorts, but I say that in a great way. Its clean, Ive never seen one table that has not been cleared in minutes. counters constantly wiped down too! The cooking work area is small and cramp for the employees, but boy do they know how to dance around each other and get food out.  My last two visits with my son had us rushed to get to the pool for warm-ups. They knocked it out with blazing fast service and delivery of food. Food above average, but plating not so much. Service friendly and efficient is their trademark. Prices are as good as a IHOP, or better. I would choose them over a chain any day.  Come here and thank me later if you are reading this review. But dont get mad if there is a line, expect a line, there will be a line. What you will remember is filling your belly with some delicious food with great service at a fair price.

I had eggs and potatoes. My wife had pork chops. Food was good, service was excellent. Good normal diner fare. Id go back again when Im in town.

My family and I visited here while visiting my oldest child who is attending UMD. ??On our first visit, we were very pleased. ??The food was excellent. ??The pancakes and waffles were delicious and the eggs scrambled perfectly. ??I felt a little attitude from the waitress though She was thorough but not very friendly. ??I overlooked that since the food was so good. ??A few days later we visited again. ??This time on a Saturday so there was a bit of a wait. ??We got a table after about a 15 minute wait which wasnt bad. ??However, two tables seated after ours had their orders taken first. ??We had the same waitress again (a bit of an attitude). ??I made a fuss. ??Regardless of ethnicity, first come, first served and I let her know. ??She immediately took our orders. ??The grits had lumps in them and the over easy eggs were not so good. ??The hash browns were tough around the edges. ??The pancakes were still on point though. ??On both visits the price was good. ??I doubt well be back!

Decent place. Good grub. Good prices. Service is on the slower side but thats ok. Your usually a little hung over or drunk when you go there and dont mind the wait. One of the only places around that is open late in the area.

I went one Sunday after church all by myself around 11:45. ??The wait was so long and the hostess so slow I left without being seated even though there was an open space at the counter when I arrived and no other party of one. ??Also, the bacon and potatoes were precooked and sitting in large tubs on the grill. ??If Im going to wait a long time, Id hope the food would be cooked to order. ??I went to a national chain down the road and got seated immediately, and I suggest you do the same.

My 1st time at the Diner -*9~25~16 and I must Say Delicious with huge portions all the way around. The Staff were a delight excellent customer service throughout my time there. (Im big on the customer service) Ill DEFINITELY BE RETURNING..i love that they have an open view kitchen because you know if any funny business is happening youll see it. Unlike other places you cant see to know your order fell and they put it back on your plate. Overall this place was very clean! family oriented or college chill spot just great vibe and bellies full will have you sitting for an Hour because youre Stuffed!!! and I love it!!

I couldnt believe how difficult it was to find a diner in this area! We were trying to find a quick place to get breakfast before we hit the road back to New York, and Yelp led us here.  The diner is a tiny greasy spoon and very, very old-school (Note: not updated in any way in 40+ years).  I ordered off the kids menu as I didnt want a heaping breakfast of too many carbs and pork fat. It came with a pancake, an egg (I got it scrambled), toast and bacon. Small but filling, enough to get me through the 5-hour car ride.  This wouldnt be a destination spot for me if Im back in College Park, but would swing by if I was in a similar circumstance, looking for a quick, cheap meal.

This has been my go to diner for years. I particularly like the fajita steak, which is a huge amount of food.  Pros: - Some of the best pancakes Ive ever had - Large menu variety, overall most food is great, but I particularly recommend the breakfast options - Staff can accommodate requests and changes easily - Breakfast special (weekdays only) is really cost effective: $5 for pancakes, eggs, and bacon - Wait staff seems to be mostly lifers. Many of them have been there every Saturday and Sunday throughout the course of grad school (six years!)  Cons: - Relatively small, probably bad for groups (fixed seating) - Wait can be long, especially on weekend mornings - This place is extremely treacherous to get into. Turning left on busy Route 1 is really hard - Limited parking, this can be a pain on weekend mornings too

This was my first time coming here but it definitely wont be my last. The food was GREAT. I ordered a ham &amp; cheese omelette w/toast and home fries. The omelette was cooked PERFECTLY. Not too hard and not runny. The home fries were seasoned good. Not too much seasoning but not bland either. The toast was already buttered, (I should have told them not to because I was recovering from a night of drinking and wanted plain toast LOL.) But thats my fault.   The service was fast, friendly and efficient. This place was crowded as hell so the service being on point was a plus. I see that its 24 hours so those late nights when you wanna get something to eat after a night or partying and hanging out I would recommend this place over IHOP. Hell, I recommend this place over IHOP any hour of the day. I WILL be back sooner that later LOL.

Great start to a Saturday!!! We stumbled across this after we so the long line outside of the Silver Diner!!! From beginning to end it was a great experience. We all had breakfast. The pancakes and French toast is yummers. The staff are friendly and service was fast, hot and fresh! We will definitely add this to our list of favorite restaurants. FYI- this is a small diner. Not ideal for large groups.

Wonderful classic diner. Great service. Our server, Melissa was wonderful. It was all women working when we went.

I love coming here. The food and service is what I expect at diners, simple and hospitable. I recommend this diner to diners enthusiasts.

I might have to call American Diner Revival or Diner Rescue for this place. Its a cute diner on a busy road and seems like they get a lot of customers; University of Maryland is down the street. We came for dinner on Friday night, around 9:30pm. We live about 10 minutes from here and decided to check it out since we always passed it and wanted to try it.   They have a parking lot. The mens bathroom is on one side &amp; the womens is on the other side. One person bathroom for the womens. The push button hand dryer didnt work &amp; there werent any paper towels. Its an old bathroom, but it was clean enough to be usable .   There were maybe about 10 countertop bar seating, a few of 2-person seating, and maybe six 4-seater booths. No real decor just basic no padding booths &amp; foreign paper money taped to the top of the metal grill. I dont care for ambiance at diners, but non greasy floors would be nice!  The guy that seated us &amp; served was polite &amp; provided us with enough attention and service. He was hustling with the influx of people at 10pm.  On to the food: we think everything was frozen. We started of with chicken wings (5 wings for less than $6); it was overcooked by just looking at it. It was so dry even the bones broke. My husband got the open faced roast beef sandwich w/ gravy &amp; sides of Mac &amp; cheese &amp; French . The gravy was good with the fries! I ordered the country fried steak with country gravy and also fries and Mac and cheese as my sides. I enjoyed my country fried steak! It was crispy, but so is anything you fry frozen. The Mac and cheese had no seasoning and it was cold; I think it was EasyMac (which I dont mind at home!). . The fries were good though! I also order hot tea, it came with a Lipton tea bag, two lemon wedges &amp; honey &amp; ofcourse hot water. We did order a cinnamon bun to go. Didnt eat it yet, but it looks hard.  My rating is basically on food. While I can see why people come here, I dont foresee making this a place we come to. My husband says the prices werent bad, but if you get frozen food at the price, it wasnt cheap. Lets just say his tummy was hurting after we left and I woke up this morning wondering what I ate  Maybe breakfast is better?

I know most of you, like me, enjoy a detour down the greasy spoon at times. This place exemplifies all that is a classic dinner. The difference though is this place teaches all others how to deliver really flavorful plates with character an a smile.   The place is so good you can almost picture folks from other diners eating there. Its a classic eatery so if your looking for a Teds Bulletin experience you will be well off. This is your Mels Diner type of spot where you chat the waiter and cooks up while watchin them cook your near perfect meal.

I hadnt been here in a long while so an updated visit was needed:  1) Ordered the Belgian waffles and got two chicken tenders so I could make my own version of chicken and waffles. ??The tenders were crisp and golden brown and the waffle was light and fluffy. ??Great combination and the sweet tea hit the spot  2) hot chocolate with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce was a good size. ?? Rich and decadent...cant have too many of those at one time  3) chicken fried steak with hash brown and fried eggs. ??The gravy was flavorful   4) chicken tenders and a 4th meal of hash and eggs. ??Reviewed before so will skip this time   Keep up the good work

My friends and I had been craving breakfast earlier that day, and we stumbled in around 1am on a Sunday morning. There was an (over)adequate amount of workers, probably 2 waitresses, 2 cooks, and 2 cashiers ??- just stating the facts, but not complaining. A group of other college students walked in not long after us along with a couple late shift workers, helping us populate the 24 hour diner.  I ordered off the kids menu - 1/2 a waffle (what did they do with the other half??), a sausage pattie, a fried egg, and an extra side of hash browns. The waffle was the average kind from those flip machines, but it satisfied my breakfast craving as I slathered it with butter and syrup. I actually had 2 eggs on my plate because the waitress said the cook messed up, which I was fine with.  However, the star of the table were the hash browns, and in a similar fashion, they showed up when the show (and rest of our entrees) were finished. Despite their late appearance, the hash browns were perfectly crisp on the outside, with deliciously greasy undertones. Ugh, so good - I would come back just for these tubers.  I like this place. It has a nice local feel, and you can sit at the counter and watch them fry up your meal. I know this place gets very crowded on the weekend mornings, so come early, or in our case, come EXTRA early!

If you are a fan of good ole fashioned diners then this is your spot. ??Great food, great prices, great service. ??The crowd can be a little seedy, but thats to be expected of diner type places. ??Also expect a wait if its weekend morning/brunch times. ??We each had eggs, sausage and pancakes or French toast. ??Plus coffee and fruit and bill was about $27.

Everything was wonderful !! The entire staff was friendly and very attentive! ! The organization of food prep and service worked like a well oiled machine  . This was my first time here and I will be back very very soon ! The our server Eliza was so cool she was like a homegirl Ive known for years ! Come check this place out, ??BEST breakfast ever !

Food was average at best. Had the 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes and a grilled chicken sub.   Atmosphere was lacking, there was 1 server and 1 cook, 1 cook/clean-up. Server was nice despite the place being super busy.

We came here because we were looking for a breakfast restaurant close to midnight LOL. This is an awesome diner/dive restaurant. Unlike Dennys its not a franchise and has an authentic unique feel. The patrons were mainly UMD students but we also so some SWAT team type officers in the wake of recent national unrest. Service was good..!

I loved sitting at the counter and watching the ladies make my meal. food was good but not spectacular. its diner food so how can you complain? I had a ham and cheese omelette, home fries and hot chocolate. toast came with it. also ordered smoked sausage which was good....the home fries are seasoned very well and have good onion in them. hot chocolate was amazing with the sweet whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.

Yea, Im not sure of all the hoopla! ??Just a typical diner. ??Got stares of why are you here by a black chef and a white waitress with bunny ears on her head upon entering. ??But it was late, and I didnt wanna go to Taco Bell or Dennys. ??Had to kinda look at the waitress like umm are you going to bring a menu? ??They seem friendly to people they know, but others kinda get a stank stare lol.  Standard eggs, hash browns, and sausage. ??It came with juice, so I got cranberry. ??That was refreshing. ??Overall, meh just standard breakfast fare. ??Not sure what gold they served customers of these other reviews.

Read the older reviews and decided to go since we were in the area. Very disappointing. My pancakes were ehhhj and hubbies biscuits and chipped beef were the same.the hash browns were barely done. inexpensive and good portions which is probably why folks live this place. A similar breakfast can be found at any fast food chain .

The College Park diner always satisfies my late night AND day-time craving, whether it may be through spicy hot chicken wings, mozzarella sticks at late-night OR spicy buffalo chicken wraps during the day time. ??I used to frequent here and after moving to Baltimore, I still have random cravings here and there.   Last week, I visited the diner and ordered my usual of spicy buffalo chicken wrap -- to my surprise, they even offer the option of tomato wrap and spinach wraps, in addition to the normal wrap. ??The healthy options also expanded to grilled chicken, in addition to just fried chicken. ??I could not help myself and and ordered a spinach wrap, to be toasted, with avocado smeared nicely on, nicely diced fried chicken, and provolone cheese, diced tomatoes, lettuce, and of course hot sauce. ??The memories flooded back. ??This meal also included either pretzels or chips with a pickle, both given in abundance. ??  Great option for a mid-day or late night snack if you are in the CP area. ??Not to mention, the campus is one of the most beautiful campuses in the whole U.S. -- filled with luxurious trees and squirrels.

All around standard diner. Nothing really special but they have good serving sizes. Meatloaf is amazing!

Soooo...I found myself in CP this past weekend as one of my sons attends UMD and wasnt coming home this weekend. Had it just been myself and my sons, I would have opted for Chipotle as, lets face it--teenage boys + Chipotle go together like pancakes and syrup. However, I also had my octogenarian mom with me who is not a fan of anything remotely resembling spicy, even if it is merely the name of a restaurant. Having a brother who is ALMOST as much of a fan of bargains as I am, I asked him for suggestions on where to eat and this is what he recommended. Its a little further away from UMD than I would have expected (translation: piece of cake in a car ride--not so much walking, especially with how torn up portions of Rt. 1 are these days).  We ventured up Rt. 1 until we located the restaurant--maybe two miles from the campus? and went inside. We quickly learned that its a seat yourself kind of establishment and sat down at a booth, after grabbing a few menus. Several minutes later, another family of four came in and sat down at a separate booth. I was momentarily miffed when I saw the server approach them before coming to our table. However, she came over to our table immediately following and, honestly, is it worth it to get miffed over a 30ish second delay? Yeah...I didnt think so, either. My 15 yr. old son was captivated by the photograph of the hot chocolate in their menu and asked for some--I told him sure but then said, You DO realize that the actual product doesnt ever look as good as the display, dont you? Ha ha--joke was on me. The hot chocolate looked every bit as good--and tasted it, too!   Our actual food items consisted of egg salad sandwich (for me--wasnt expecting the bread to be toasted but it was fine, although it could have used some crunch in it other than the bread, like celery), 7 steak and cheese sub (for my 15 yr. old--he said it needed more meat and that there were about three onions on it), open-faced turkey sandwich w/ mashed potatoes/gravy and fried okra (a home run on all counts!) and my mom got the senior breakfast of 1/2 waffle (which was generously portioned), scrambled egg and two sausage links (the sausage was ehh at best).   At one point, I decided to, um, powder my nose...and my son warned me that the bathroom was probably dirty. Not that the restaurant was--it wasnt. It was just a hole in the wall looking restaurant so the natural assumption was that the bathroom would follow suit. I was pleased to report back that not only was the bathroom clean, it was VERY clean--as in freshly mopped and wiped. Thats a major plus, in my book.  I wont rave about the quality of the food but I will report that, aside from the few issues noted above, our lunch there was enjoyable. Our server was pleasant, the service was efficient, the restaurant (and bathroom!) were both clean and paying $37 for a meal for four people without any coupons is fine in my book. Will I lie awake at night dreaming about the next visit there? No. However, do I feel that I made a good choice and were all of us happy with the end results? Yep. Sounds like a win to me.

Wow! ??STERLING service with fantastic breakfast fare. The staff is both attentive and responsive. Very busy and yet we landed seats quickly. One of the best diner experiences Ive ever had in Maryland!! ??Highly recommended!!

HORRIBLE... my fiend asked for buffalo wings (because theyre on the menu), with extra sauce on the side.. she was brought regular fried wings and a pack of blue cheese salad dressing.. When the waitress was told they werent buffalo, she said the sauce was cooked into them.. NOT!.. ??then she said well, thats all we have...  I ordered country friends steak with mashed potatoes.. just awful... watched the cool who was pregnant btw, way and didnt even have a mat to stand on behind the grill, making the mashed potatoes.. POURING THE INSTANT FLAKES OUT OFVTHE BOX.. they tasted like wallpaper paste.. ??Then, observed the cook cooking piles and piles of bacon for the weeks meals.. THEY DONT EVEN COOL IT FRESH TO ORDER.. will never go back.. it was the first AND the last time..  Awful.. just awful..

The food was wonderful and I would have given it 5 stars if the service was better. I had the country fried steak which was crispy and perfect with hash browns and gravy. My daughter had the French toast with strawberries and whipped cream. She said it tasted as good as it looked, which was fabulous! My other daughter had the pancakes which I just had to try after seeing some mixed reviews. My whole family thought they were delicious! Would definitely come again if in the area!

Good food and friendly staff in this small greasy spoon diner. It was a little more expensive than I would have liked but we both had plenty of food. Would consider coming again but plan to typically wait for a table.

What can I say? This place is a sure bet. Ive been coming here for years. Everything on the menu that Ive tried has been good, but in my opinion, the breakfast offerings are the best. The omelettes are huge, and you can build your own. They serve very generous portions of everything and the service is consistently good, even during the wee hours of the night.

Nice local spot. On the weekends be prepared for lines going out the door. Has that old diner feel where you watch your food being cooked in front of you. All the breakfast foods are very good. Check out the wall over the prep area where customers bring currency from their country and it is mounted on the wall

I dont know what diner the other reviewers were eating at, but this place is nothing special. For the prices they charge you can get better quality and have your order made correctly at a Silver Diner. Hell even Tastee diner. Was asked if I wanted fried onions on my sub. Yes please but no fried onions. Asked for hot peppers, watched them refill the pepper tray right next to my sub but leave those off too. The drinks we ordered were all but forgotten if I hadnt reminded them 15 minutes later. Coffee sucked. Maybe if the staff would have concentrated on making the food right to order it would have justified the money I didnt here, but they didnt and now the first and only memory of this joint is poor food and being out $25 + tip, which in truth was undeserved and a real waste of money. ??Go to IHOP instead.

I wasnt expecting much out of the College Park Diner. Im sure its great if youre hammered but...I wasnt. Came in for breakfast and everything was pretty standard. Good milkshakes! ??  Service was good and they crank out the food from that little tiny grill up front which is impressive.

A sweet down home diner just off the DC Beltway and near UMD. ??I loved my strawberry Belgium Waffle topped with whipped cream. No butter or syrup necessary. ??Nom nom nom. Id easily stop here the morning after a night partying. Good stuff.

FANTASTIC food and service! ??Got seated quickly. ??They accommodated my vegan diet with tomatoes and lettuce on bread and breakfast potatoes. ??Yummy!

Its okay. Not great. Not horrible. If you want quick food. We ordered breakfast items and they were tasteless eggs, waffles, hash browns and a frozen biscuit. Blah.

Your experience at CP Diner really depends on what you are looking for.   If you are looking for a hole in the wall-esc diner with classic comfort food - this is the diner to go to in College Park. One of my favorite deals is the weekday breakfast special (2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon/ sausage for $3.99 - cant be beat).   However, if you want a healthier breakfast this probably isnt the place for you. The other day I tried to go healthy and ordered an omelette. It was greasy and overloaded with cheese.   Another downside to this establishment is a lack of chocolate chips or iced coffee. What diner doesnt have chocolate chip pancakes? And yes, the diner does have coffee - however, they will not serve it over ice.  But overall, very solid diner when it comes to basic, tasty, and satisfying breakfast.

This diner serves a righteous breakfast. It takes a while to get a table, but it was worth the wait. ??  Pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon were hot, and fresh. This place stays busy. Oh did I mention the French toast are huge pieces of Texas toast.

The food is amaaaaaazing! I dont care how long I have to wait (which is never that long) because the food and the service is worth it.

Ate here at least once a week for quite some time. The place is low cost and pretty tasty. The quality of food isnt fantastic, but all of my meals have been made fresh to order. The $3.95 special is unbeatable and the rush on the weekends is crazy but worth it - food must taste better when theres a packed restaurant. Otherwise, parking is sometimes difficult and the service is good.

On a whim, my man called me to meet him for breakfast before work today. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and met him at the College Park Diner. Of all the hundreds of times I have passed this diner, I never went in. OMG! I am SO happy I went and I will definitely be back soon. I had the simple pancakes and scrambled eggs and turkey bacon. The food was absolutely delicious! ??The pancakes in particular, are amazing! It was the perfect amount of food and even the coffee was good! I keep asking myself WHY I didnt go sooner?! Whatever! I will be back for a Belgian waffle in the very near future!

Great place for food and socializing! Sara and the staff were excellent! Stop in when you are in the area! You will not be disappointed. I got a BLT and was very satisfied. The person next to me is a regular and his tuna salad sandwich looked awesome! I will get that next time.

Great place for some breakfast food especially. Service is quick, sweet tea is wow really sweet but good. Great omelets, and waffles, a must for anyone that loves good quick diner food. Would love it if they changed them small booths.

This is the most diner of diners in college park. You walk in and everyone is just so friendly and kind, its a treat watching the cook. Theyre mesmerizing about how they cook the food with such clockwork. The omelettes do not disappoint and the coffee is also good. Also there is always parking.

Well, this used to be a nice place to get a late dinner. ??Went in there last weekend on a not-very-crowded night and couldnt even get drink orders in! ??The staff was very obviously ignoring us. ??Some friends of mine said they had the same bad experience there, waiting an hour and a half before leaving, without one waitperson coming to assist them. ??Very much a blacks-only establishment now. ??I dont mind people wanting to serve select clientele, thats their right, but they should put a sign in their window that says No whites allowed

Seriously not sure how anyone can give this an ok. The food really isnt that bad. I just cant believe how bad service was. Came later at night and watched over people leave for how bad service was. Food came out all different times and people were complaining and walking out. Overall 2/5. Service was a 1/5 food was a 2.5/5

As a diner should be... We ordered biscuits sausage and gravy , french toast and scrambled eggs . ??Good portion size , great classic diner flavors . Keep in mind its a small place so may have to wait . The staff is efficient and on it.

My husband and I discovered this place because I hope was closed. We didnt have high hopes because its a little dilapidated but to be honest we were very surprised that the food was very good and the ladies where nice.   We have had breakfast with steak, then hamburger sub was awesome (only complaint its I got to little fries for my taste) country fried steak was delicious as well. Our friend had the chari pie and he said it was very good. We recommend it.  I will say I dont give it five stars because of the Decour and also because sometimes you have to wait a lot.   PS. LOVEEEEE TGE HOT CHOCOLATE WITH WHIPPED CREAM

Watching the short order cook work the grill Im not seeing any magic. Undercooked hash browns and overcooked eggs. Its not very busy and everyone here is at the counter but my coffee cup is empty. Probably because theres only one waitress.  This is not the best breakfast Ive ever had. It is however edible but Im hitting a Waffle House tomorrow.

I am really shocked at the reviews after eating here. Nothing is homemade...not even the french toast. It is clearly just re-heated frozen french toast. I asked about the biscuits and she said the waitress told me they were pillsbury style. I asked for poached eggs and they were inedible - the center was hard and the whites were rubbery. ??Even the bacon was rubbery - I have no idea how one makes bacon anything other than delicious.   Theres an Ihop down the street...just go there.

The worst piece of steak I have ever had. I wasnt expecting much, given that its a diner. But, it just tasted spoiled, bad, I mean really bad. Not to mention the service was terrible. I could have rounded up the local high schoolers that were untrained in food service and had better service. This is not deserving of the four star reviews.

Yummy, yummy yummy breakfast. Kids had the French toast with cheese eggs and bacon. The French toast was the best Ive had in years! I had an egg white omelette which was also great. The service is fast and extremely friendly. We will definitely be back!!

Super fast service. ??They got slammed when we were in there and they did awesome!!! ??The waitress kept a positive attitude during the whole time!!

For what this place is, its a decent place to go. I walked in and was given immediate direct contact, she could tell it was my first time, I did not grab her name, but she said sit anywhere. Its a small place not to many booths and it was mostly filled. I found a spot the same woman was my server and she was exactly how I would want her to be. She came to me quickly got my drink(I want to mention it was really cold kind of pushes you to order something hot) I got a hot tea and French toast. It didnt take long she didnt come back till she handed me my food but for 10:30am when I was just wasting some time I didnt mind at all. The food was good Im not a fan of French toast but I like they added a cinnamon confection powder which gave it a nice taste. It was 4 slices for $5.50 it was a good place. Overall really good place. Will come back  Smile!

This is the absolute strangest place in College Park. Its basically the quintessential diner. Its a small menu, pretty cramped seating, the coffee is Folgers and the tea is Lipton. But this doesnt make it a bad place-- far from it! What they do they do well. The kitchen (which you can see quite plainly from your seat) is a well-oiled machine made to pump out food. They know exactly what theyre doing, in the way that doing something a thousand times will provide. The pancakes, eggs, toast-- theyre all cooked to perfection, and youll get your meal in only a few minutes, no matter how busy the place is.  One thing to note is that its EXTREMELY loud. They work so fast they have no time to try and be quiet. Do not ever come here with a hangover, it will only be the death of you. But for those who are fine with it, its definitely a great place to grab breakfast!

Kind attentive service. Minimum oil/seasoning made for comfortable, clean tasting food. Fresh coffee. Everything was great except that the table could have been cleaner.

I bin eating here sence it originally barn side diner the best breakfast and everything is awesome here

A great old fashioned diner. I had a chef salad and it was fresh, huge, and delicious! ??The waitress was very attentive, but didnt hover. The check was less than ten dollars. Ill be back!!

I really like this place, its not big but the stuff are really fresh here, and the breakfast and brunch here are soooo good! Pancakes, omelette, bacon....~~ its a small restaurant but they are really careful and serious doing things!

Best place to eat breakfast in Laurel, Hands Down!clean, good service, better food. We come at least once a month.

Never fails. A favorite, for many reasons. Food is well cooked. Service is fast. Good, hot comfort food.

I was in town because my cousin was celebrating her birthday. On our way home, Mister and I decided to fuel up. We loved the look of the diner. It was small, had character and was busy. Thats a good sign.   We didnt wait long for a table. We ordered some breakfast but the waitress messed up our order. She forgot my eggs and took long to bring our drinks. She was more interested in the table next to us. I guess they were regulars because they all spoke Spanish and they seem pretty familiar with one another.   When dining out, I no longer complain. I just tip accordingly. That is all!

The only thing I have had here is the weekday special; 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 slice of bacon. ??It rules. ??Just go there and get a heaping helping. ??Service is efficient and friendly. ??Ambience is non-existent.

Its a nice place for brunch, the food is really fresh! The price is nice~~ love the butter with pancakes and whipped cream with french toast, really yummy!

3 words: Country Fried Steak.   Amazing omelets as well. They are way more consistent quality and service-wise than the other diners in the area (one sounds like Play-doh).

No. No no no. A friend and I stopped by here on our way home from Ikea. It looked like people liked it, I mean, the line was out the door. But, as soon as we say down it became excruciatingly clear why the line was out the door: the service was abysmal.   Save yourself from this overpriced grease spot and cook at home.

Waitress is kind of sketchy. Raspy voice and all. Mashed potatoes are super fake. Burger looks good, but overall sketchy atmosphere. 7/10

Exactly what you can expect from a diner experience. ??I sat at the bar on an early Saturday and ordered a basic breakfast. ??I enjoyed watching the one cook preparing everyones food. ??She was very efficient. ??Order and food went through quickly. ??It was an easy pit stop, can easily be the quick choice in the future. ??I left around 8am and saw that people were starting to fill the dinner, so many must feel the same!

I came in, I sat down (Wednesday, November 4th, at 6 AM), there were 3 workers working (1 male cook, 1 female taking orders, and 1 other one just wiping counter tops).  No one greeted me nor gave a menu to look at. I spotted where I menus were, and went helped myself. I sat down right by the cashier.  The SECOND that I opened up the menu to take a look at it, the girl asked me what can I get for you, sir? I replied, yes, I would like to take at the menu first, please. (With a smile). She gave me a look, then walked away, without saying anything.  1-2 minutes later, I have decided what I wanted. But she seemed busy, so I didnt want to bother her, and decided to wait patiently, until she asks me again.  She walked back and forth, passed me without making any eye contact.  Another gentlemen walked into the door, she greeted him and told him to sit anywhere he pleases.  (Im still waiting for her to make eye contact or to come take my order), but she chooses to ignore me. I figured she might just be busy with toasting all the breads for other clients...  ***A quick note- both her and the other male cook were handling food (picking up bacons, toasts, cheese with their bare hands (NO GLOVES!) The girl accidentally drop the pen she was using onto the floor, bent down to pick it up, did not wash her hands, and went handling toasts with her bare hands! The guy cracked some eggs to make some scramble eggs, and as he cracked it open, it got onto his thumb before getting into the pan. Very unsanitary. The girl again rubbed her hands onto her apron and continued to handle food.  After making me wait 15 minutes, the girl took off her apron and went to use the restroom. 5 minutes later, she came back out. I asked her, hi, can I make an order, please? She ignored me, as if I was not there. I thought she might have not heard me. She then went to the gentlemen who had just came in earlier (after me) to take his order. The lady standing next to me (who was before me and have been waiting for her food) saw that I was being ignored, so she got the girls attention to let her know that I came in first and that I have been waiting to be served, but the girl chose to disregard what the lady said as well. She continued back to that gentlemen table to serve him coffee.  At this time, I knew clearly that she was ignoring me and have been having a bad unprofessional/street like attitude. I called her over and asked how come I came in here first and have been waiting for you to take my order, but you took the other guys order first? She looked away, disregard my question and said what you getting? I responded by saying, how come I came in but you didnt take my order first? She once again ignored my question, looked away, and said what you getting? again. I said never mind and just left.  Bottom line: TERRIBLE service. EXTREMELY UNSANITARY food handling. BAD attitude. UNPROFESSIONAL.  These people should be fired. That, or the management should close down this horrible place.

Everytime I visit Baltimore ??I have to have breakfast here. The omelets are incredible and the staff is always friendly.  If you want just a really good classic style breakfast...Go here!

I love this place my favorite is the French toast yum! I love coming alone to have a great start to my day with lovely ladies to help make it great!

Good diner food. Nothing to go crazy about. The food is always tasty, but you almost always have to wait in line for a while to be seated and because of the open kitchen its really loud. I usually get the Belgian waffle with strawberries and whip cream, has never disappointed. Great place for hangover food!

Dehydrated hash browns, extra thin toast, bacon was cooked properly, eggs were decent and iced tea.  Bacon and cheese omelet- Bacon was fatty and under cooked, dehydrated hash browns and extra thin toast a glass of chocolate milk.  We had to pick up our bill at the register? ?? 20$ for this breakfast thought to be a little pricey? The place was busy we thought it would be top notch... It was just OK

Clean, simplistic, nice looking small dinner. Its one of the only places that is open 24/7 or in the late hours, that being beyond 12:01AM.   For getting French Toast, /w Two Eggs over Medium, Two sausage paddies and 4 pieces of toast /w a Coke, it cost me $12.46. (Not including tip) Other than price really I cant complain. It was pretty good and I had no complaints. Server was friendly and didnt pester me too much, (was on the phone) but at the same time my cup was never empty.   For the Price, I guess I didnt go with any breakfast specials or looked for a cost friendly choice, but I will say this place can cook a pretty good breakfast in a very clean kitchen thats out in the open behind the bar like seating area that tastes good and thankfully, doesnt immediately give you the runs afterwords. *Cough* Dennys.

Solid quality of food for the price. Good waitstaff I have never waited an exceptionally long time. I prefer to go on weekdays early afternoon when things are a little slower. Even on weekend mornings when there is a long line you usually dont wait as long as you might think. I love eating at Diners and have visited many all over the DC area and nobody serves the food quicker. I have never been served a cold meal here its always piping hot.

Cute little place, cash only. We stopped in for a quick breakfast before hitting the metro.  I had a bacon &amp; cheese omelet, grits, and coffee. The husband wanted all southern food - he had sausage biscuits &amp; gravy, grits and tea. He had agita after, but thats what he gets for eating the heavy stuff, haha.  Service was great! This is a great little local place. The place needs a bit of an update (the booths had bolts on them holding them together) but all in all a real place.

I want so bad to pick this place up and drop it around the corner from where I live in NYC (sorry Jimbos) or wherever I choose to live.  I first saw this place when staying at a nearby motel/hotel down the road in College Park.  I cant lie, what initially drew me in was the $3.95 breakfast special: 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon. For $4? Thats less than a latte at one of those coffeehouses.  So I went in expecting the bare minimum for that $4 and thats what I got, right?  Wrong.  Their pancakes are magical. Light, fluffy, and they DONT SUCK UP SYRUP like most other pancake places do (sorry IHOP - even you). I dont have to drown the pancakes in syrup to get the sweetness that I like. They are decent sized too. Eggs made anyway you like them. Heres the best part for me - even the Turkey bacon was included ??in the deal!  The second day (my first time was two weeks ago and I stayed for two days) I went in and had a full platter with three pancakes, eggs, and turkey sausage. Again, equally as good. That Sunday, I saw some football players and their people from the University of Maryland come eat too. Now with options like Dennys down the block and IHOP up the block, they were here at the College Park Diner?  From that point on - I was sold.  Ive been back twice since and tried their french toast and waffles. Theyre both really good - I prefer the waffles to the french toast. The waffles are soft but not soggy (theyre easy to cut with just a fork after you put syrup on them unlike some other waffle places that serve soggy waffles and you need a knife and fork to cut them). Their french toast comes with powder sugar and cinnamon on top.  This is a classic greasy spoon - not pretentious in the least. Come in, put your name in the spiral pad and wait a few minutes (no more than 10 Id say). Theyll call you for a booth or a counter. When youre done, hit the cash register to pay for your meal. They take cash or charge.  Five stars for keeping it real, delicious, and value friendly - for breakfast.  I need to find reasons to keep visiting the College Park are now - particularly by the College Park Diner.

Service: I consider myself and my friends regulars of this diner. We frequent the restaurant after nights out, as it operates on very college-friendly hours. Waiters and waitresses are super friendly and quite frankly, memorize orders as you begin to eat here more and more.   Food: Food here is perfect for drunk munchies and definitely suitable for a quick breakfast or lunch. The portions are size able and prices very reasonable. No complaints at all!  Environment: Being a college town diner, the place can get fairly loud late in the night. At most other times of the day however, the Diner is filled with the usual quiet locals and a nice place to spend time,  Overall, I think this place has done very well for itself. Keep up the good work CP Diner!

Good service &amp; price with a decent food. ??My wife had pancakes and eggs that was good. I had steak and eggs that was okay.

This is your run of the mill local diner. ??Nothing wrong with it at all, but Ive been to better spots. ??Chicken fried steak was OK, pancake / hash browns were pretty good. ??My wife had a burger that was just fine. ??Quick service, place seemed a bit dingy but heck, its a diner.

The food is good. Came out fast. All female staff. The bathroom is disgusting!!!!!!!! Ok, back to the food. Yum

The food was EXCELLENT! ??Way better than I-Hop. ??They know how to cook eggs! ??Seasoning was good, corned beef hash was made into a pattie and fried like a hamburger, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. ??My hash browns were the real stuff and cooked just right. ??Toast I ordered was white and a splatter of butter was spread on it. ??YUM! ??Oh, and the coffee Mmmm..... ??although, I love my coffee mild, if you like your Starbucks coffee, than dont order the coffee here. ??The service was EXCELLENT! ??My waiter refilled my coffee when it was half full, paid attention to when he judged I was ready to order, brought my food to me within 10 minutes. ??Yes, excellent service. ??The only down side I experienced was, waiting for my check, until I remembered reading someone elses comments here and I walked up to the register where my check was, and was promptly rung up.  Food lunch and dinner in my area pretty much suck and I dont hardly support the eatery here. ??This morning I felt like a home cooked breakfast but did not want to drive to far. ??Thanks to Yelp, I found this restaurant and I am grateful for the comments. ??I will be visiting this establishment for breakfast more often. ??Thanks YELP!

Great little diner. ?? In and out quickly. ?? Food was good but a bit pricy for breakfast at a diner

Stopped in for breakfast before a U of Maryland campus visit based on the yelp reviews. ??Service was fast &amp; friendly and the food was tasty. ??Id return anytime Im in the neighborhood.  We waited a while for the check until our waitress let us know that we could just go up to the register and have them find our bill. ??Ill know better next time.

I come to this diner at least once a month. I love how fast and how fresh the food is. The service is especially nice every time I come. When people come from out of town to visit me, I try to take them here for the experience.  I usually get the Belgium waffle and a side of corned beef hash. ??Its so good every single time!

Loved this diner, will definitely return if I am in the area! They know how to do their eggs, the sausages were excellent!!

I would put the College Park diner in the same category as a waffle house or a Huddle house. They have a relatively okay food, but the atmosphere lacks a little to be desired. This is not somewhere i would eat on a regular basis, however, it is still good for that occasional early morning or extremely late night meal. ??The staff was friendly enough, and at the time we went, there was a line virtually out the door. This is obviously a community favorite, however, I am not so sure why.

Ive lived in the CP area for sometime and I have always passed this diner and never stopped in until last week. ??I work overnights so on my way home I was uber hungry and decided to stop in. ??I was greeted with a smile from the clerk and was given a menu. ??I got the steak, scrambled eggs, cheesy grits and toast and let me tell you IT WAS GOOOOO OOOD! Reminded me so much of some good ol home cookin! ??The only thing I would say negative is that their butter is waaaaaaaaaaay tooooooo rich! Ive never tasted anything so concentrated! ??But it wont keep me away, as a matter of fact since last week Ive picked up breakfast there 3x since. ??My arteries will certainly need a good scrubbin!

Every time I come here, I fall a little further in love with the place.  A few dishes stand out to me -- the country fried steak is a must-have. The gravy is delicious and theyre generous with it. ??Im a fan of their corned beef hash, too. ??But the biscuits? A great accent to any breakfast platter.  You have to watch when you come here on the weekends - theres a good chance youll have a brief wait if its crowded. ??Rest assured that its always worth the wait, because the food will be quick and tasty.

Really good for a local diner. ??Long line so get there early-especially on a weekend.

Great food family friendly everything looks organized genuine diner decor. ??Milkshakes are good. ??Burgers and breakfast seem to be their thing. ??Definitely not fancy. ??Some graffiti in the bathroom (nothing clever).

Not sure why other reviewers are saying this is cash only - I was able to get my meal with my credit card not but two weeks ago.  The Big B is pretty good, and the prices are reasonable. ??They are really FAST with bringing your food out. ??Perfect place to stop by at 5am after a sleepless night.  Much less crowded than the ihop down the street, and a more comfortable feel.

This is a great spot to grab food when everything else is closed. Its clean, the crowd is cool and the food is pretty damn good. Dont expect gourmet food of course but the french toast and pancakes are delicious.

This place is so nice and cozy. Its small but they keep it movin. Their syrup is the BEST Ive ever tasted. If your used to IHOP and Dennys eggs, then youll fall in love with their hand cracked eggs. The Belgium waffle is great. The service is fast! What are you waiting for?!?!

They are quick, ??cheap, ??and good. ?? It reminds me of waffle house. ??Sometimes you have to wait a while because theyre so busy, but its worth the wait. ??I usually get the special which is 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon for $4.

I was so excited to come here. I am not a fan of chain restaurants and I was excited to give this a shot. The place is small and very charming. The food was flawless, I got the breakfast deal on the specials board. I can honestly say the hash browns were the best Ive ever had at a restaurant!   I was disappointed with the staff. Im a server myself, so I completely understand how busy you can get at times. She just handed us the bill then never came back. I literally had no idea what the hell I was supposed to do with it. I tried to get her attention several times but she ignored me (I was paying with a credit card). ??After about 15 minutes and 589430859042859042 employees passing us, another patron told us we needed to go upfront to pay.   Regardless, Ill be back for those hash browns.

Saterday noon, a lot of customer but they service super nice &amp; fast. Five stars for that!!!

EVERYTHING A DINER SHOULD BE!   This is just a good ol Greasy Spoon. ??The kind where, once your done eating here, you hate yourself for it - and you smell like a greasy diner for a few hours afterwards.  What more could you ask for? Its Open 24/7 too.  They have Hash Browns (which I prefer), and not Home Fries! ??Biscuits &amp; Gravy, Bacon, Sausage, Egg, &amp; Cheese, Omelets, Grits Pancakes, Waffles, Etc. mmmmm.... ?? I ate it all, and I go back regularly.  They say they have the best SOS too, though Ill never know.  They also serve lunch &amp; dinner food. Ive had their Patty Melt w/fries &amp; gravy, and Chicken Fried Steak.   No complaints here - Just artery clogging comfort food, when youre in the mood.   Only downside (besides the adverse health effects) is it gets pretty busy on Sundays after church.

Went for breakfast, its good, classic diner fare. Loved the all-female crew and the price was right. Check it out if youre looking for a breakfast staple.

Ive always liked this spot, for me it kind of fills that waffle house void with quick good breakfast. ??My wife often eats the lunch/dinner items, everything usually looks fresh and she likes it.

Ihop what??? Best flavored pancakes here! Youd be surprised how this little place hits the spot.

They get busy during the weekend mornings. Good food. Clean. There are very reasonably priced ! My favorite breakfast/brunch/late night spot .

I love this place. It definitely looks like one of those places that you would drive by and overlook. Its not a huge place. Nor is it a chain restaurant but it certainly holds its own. You come in and seat yourself and a waiter will be over to help you. They always have a special and the food is always good. Ive never come in and been disappointed. Definitely a place I would recommend to family and friends.

I typically only rate good restaurant but I felt compelled to rate this one. I passed up an IHOP rated at 2.4 to go to CP Diner due to 4 rating. ??I get it that it is a trendy little 24 hour diner but I am not seeing a four conversely it seems that IHOP is a victim of being non-trendy thus a 2.4.

Ive been going to CP diner for a few years now and it is definitely considered a hole in the wall with quick cheap food. They are always opened and breakfast is served at all hours of the day. I personally am not a big breakfast food eater but my boyfriend LOVES this place. He always gets the breakfast special: 2 eggs cooked how you want, 2 meats, 2 pancakes for $3.95.  I always try something different, the vegetable omelet with a side of grits and buttered wheat toast on the side- tasty and filling. Their gravy on the mashed potatoes is good too. Try it as a side. Mac and cheese needs some flavor- it looks cheesy and flavorful but I think it just might be the color thats throwing me off. The Belgium waffles MELT in your mouth. Very good. I just wish they had different toppings!  Bathroom is clean and the staff is very friendly. Check this place out if you want quick food that wont break your budget

Always go there for breakfast, lunch or dinner love the food!! There is one nice waitress that I always like the she treat us every time we go there.

Very good breakfast and more money for the food you are ordering. I got the French toast with 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon. It came up to like $6. It was actually a very nice amount of food. Definitely sit at the counter if you are going in the morning on a weekend. It gets pretty busy and the service is a lot faster if you just sit at the counter. Happy eats!

College Park Diner is exactly what you expect to be a fast-paced diner to be. We were a party of 2 and we were seated quickly, despite it being a Sunday morning. We ate at the counter, which was pretty cool because we could watch the staff cook everything at the grill. Its incredible how quickly they can prepare food! The food was typical diner food - not gourmet, but certainly tasty. I had the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon special (for about $4) and my husband had the chipped beef and gravy. Both meals were good. I plan to try an omelette next time (they use real eggs, I watched!).   The pros:  Fast service Your coffee cup is never empty Food is prepared well  The cons:   The place is a little small, so it wouldnt be great for a group larger than about 4 people

I remember when this place was Barnside! Loved coming here for breakfast in the wee hours of the morning... or night depending on how you look at it! Its not the nicest breakfast place but its a great place to chill and grab a bite to eat late at night since its open 24/7.  Its also probably not the healthiest option because Im pretty sure everything is cooked in grease! But its good for the price you pay!  You will come out smelling like breakfast food!

Very poor service the young lady had literally three tables and was acting like she was so busy my kids and I where sitting there for 15 mins and was not helped .so eventually went to IHOP .I do not recommend this restaurant at all.Also there spiders and what not and it was really dusty .

About as diner-y a diner as you could ask. Seat yourself, take a look at the menu, and decide what looks good for breakfast. I was surprised to see S.O.S offered, so I decided to go for it out of nostalgia. The chipped beef is served with their white gravy over toast or biscuits (I went biscuits) and you get a very healthy portion, though I would have liked a little more meat on my plate.  The coffee isnt amazing, but its hot and refilled quickly.   Its not a bad option for a more substantial breakfast than McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts, but Im not sure its an exceptional one, either.

Found this place doing a yelp search for breakfast as we were traveling through the area. ??Food was fresh and delicious and you can see them making it right in front of you. ??Ive never seen a restaurant operate this well.

You can literally be seated, order breakfast, eat and pay your bill in under 30 mins here! Oh... and for like 5 bucks!  Even when the place looks packed trust me, youll never have to wait more than 2 mins for a table, people are always coming and going. Ive been on off peak hours and Saturday morning busy, everybody running around hours and still had good food and service. The breakfast is bomb what can I say? Everything feels homemade, I even like their cheese eggs! And for a picky egg eater, they have some good cheesy eggs! French toast. Bomb. Pancakes. Bomb. All their bacon/sausage sides. Bomb. I usually order off of the senior menu LOL! They have perfect portions, not 5 pancakes not 1 but just the right about.   Took off a star because I love blueberry pancakes... yum! But they dont make them fresh they make the pancakes and put the blueberry topping on the side, theyre little baby blueberries in some kind of blueberry sauce :( not my fave.

This is a good little spot, found it on Yelp with good reviews since we were staying at the hotel down the street. A lot of choices and good prices -- since it is a diner! And very busy noisy, but I give it to that staff, they were good at running the place. The thing we loved was the home fries, very good with lots of flavor!

The good: +Friendly service and fast. +Delicious food. +Convenient hours.  The bad: -Small booths. I mean really small - Im overweight and they nearly cut me in half, but I saw regular sized people having to squeeze in. -Often crowded so expect a wait.

Great little diner. Im down here for work this week and ordered the SOS or chipped beef and gravy over biscuits, a double order of hash browns, and an apple juice. GREAT choice! The cook gets a nod in my book as well for handling the 6 tickets all at once on the grill.

Its your classic American Diner -- doing what Diners do: good basic food, similar to many long-established others along highways and in cities throughout the country. The specialty is basic breakfast 24-hrs/day, with a few other basic standby options for Lunch and Dinner.  Ive been eating there for years, daily or occasionally when living or passing through the area. Its a regular-place thats got the fundamentals, economical decent eats, good service -- that yes, may have its ups and down periods or days, but is generally what you expect and good.  Home-cooking or American-food, but its both better and worse than that; its classic Diner-food. You get what you came for, solid food and a comfortable no-frills place to eat and talk or read yer paper.   Where else you gonna get grits made proper, or scrapple, or chicken-fried steak or SOS, the daily special, or as someone noted fried-okra -- and change back from your Ten-spot or Twenty?   Service is generally fast, and generally good -- though there have been students or temps in-training. Hey its life, real-life; ya get past it and move on down the road; likely to stop, coming back through.  Weekdays are generally seat-yourself, with a sign-in list on weekend mornings. Also as someone noted its either Counter or Booths for 2 or 4 (maybe 5) -- larger groups will have to split-up.  For me its home, an oasis, in an otherwise expensive or franchise fast-food world.

Ive lived in Maryland all my life and am disappointed to say I have just found this jewel. My boyfriend and I decided to come here after hanging at UMD. I got the french toast and they were AMAZEBALLS. There is no other word to capture the perfection. They were fluffy and sweet and wonderful. Ive only had their breakfast but I can only imagine what lunch and dinner is like!

Wonderful place to eat. Staff is helpful and nice. They have small amount of items but they are really good, I enjoyed the waffles and pancakes. The eggs are delicious the ham and sausage as well. I recommend this small diner to anyone on a budget.

My favorite diner! ??I have had the French toast, waffles, scrambled eggs and their chocolate shake. ??I would not go anywhere else! ??I have been here during the day as well as late night and they always have good service.

The College Park Diner (formerly the Barnside Diner) has one big thing going for it: THEY NEVER CLOSE. ??The College Park area has a few diners... but this is the only one that will serve you 24/7. ??Its pretty much the only place to get food in College Park after 3AM on a weeknight. ??  The food is predictable diner food, generally well-executed. ??You can get the usual spread of pancakes, waffles, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, etc. ??Prices are reasonable and there is always a special. ??They have a number of dishes besides breakfast food, but Id stick to the breakfast fare. ??Theyve got some interesting things on the menu, like scrapple, creamed chipped beef, and fried okra. ??I always get an order of okra with any meal. ??  The diner itself is nothing fancy. ??Its got a counter and booths, all self-seating. ??Theyve recently painted the place, but its still a little dingy and greasy. ??The bathrooms are generally clean. ??I love to call this place a hole in the wall because several years ago, someone drove a car through the wall of the diner. ??There was a literal hole in the wall for months before they repaired it. ??  The service can be a bit slow or surly, but as long as theyll slop out my grits at 4AM - whos complaining?

Its very average diner food, service, and ambiance with a few stand-outs. The breakfast special was inexpensive and the pancakes were delicious. They were the best thing I tried at CP Diner. It tasted like they put a little vanilla in their batter which made for some exceptionally tasty pancakes. The sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy that my boyfriend ordered were also pretty good. Even though were Northerners, we appreciate a solid rendition of this dish. These placed somewhere in the middle, edging towards the better end of the spectrum. It was nice to dine in a locals joint while I was visiting town. Atmosphere is very cliche diner. Our server was nice, but did forget about two juices that we ordered. Also, I ran out of coffee which sat empty for several minutes, which is uncommon in most diners. Usually coffee is the number one thing servers stay on top of. They did clean up our table really promptly, which was nice. Worth a try: Prices good. Service adequate. Food decent.

Great home-style food... ??Waffles and beefchip gravy. ??Courteous wait staff. ??Great value.

College Park Diner is a diner in every sense of the word: Small, packed, cheap and the waitresses call you Hon. ??Theres a counter to boot.  This diner is located in the college town of University of MD, College Park and Im sure is regularly visited by the students. ??Im pretty sure its a 24/7 establishment.  The food is good and solid. ??You wont find gourmet offerings but you will find the run-of-the-mill bacon, pancakes and eggs; which, by the way, is $3.95!  It can get crowded but the wait is never too long and once you get in, you will be served within 10 minutes. ??I go here after church on Sunday mornings. ??Most times I eat in but I have taken home on occasion. ??  I love this place

I decided to try this place because Im having my car serviced nearby. ??I ordered the cream chip beef because it was legendary according to the menu, however it was terrible. ??Avoid the cream chip beef.  So why the four star rating you might ask? ??Well, as I looked around, other peoples food looked great, and very large portions. ??The place was busy, so Im going to assume I just picked the wrong item on the menu.  I will try this place next time I bring my car for service and will definately try something else.

One of my all-time favorite restaurants. If you go here when its not packed, you can get your food in 5-10 minutes. They know how to cook eggs exactly how you want them. I usually get the Big B breakfast platter. Their breakfast sandwiches are great and only $4. The creamed chipped beef is awesome, the biscuits &amp; gravy is awesome, the country fried steak is awesome. They have fried okra, grits, ham, half-smokes, scrapple, cherry pie. I could probably eat here every day. Their french toast is pretty good too.  Also, you get a great view of them cooking the food and the staff is usually very nice and helpful. Also, you dont have to wait to be seated, you just sit wherever you want.  The bathrooms could be nicer in both decor and cleanliness, and paper towels would be a welcome addition. Even during peak hours like in the morning on weekends, I was still able to get my food in about 10 minutes.   If you show up after Midnight, be prepared to pay up front before you sit down to eat.

Cant beat the $4 breakfast special, available all day! Great service too. :)

Id give it give but... Its a breakfast diner. Good food good service good value. Really hit the sport when I needed it.   Had a short wait on a saturday, but I generally consider that a good thing - people like it

The food is great, the service is excellent and the staff is amazing. Yes is a dinner, but not crazy greasy. According to my mom best hashbrowns shes ever had!

Needed a spot between DC and Baltimore to meet for breakfast and this place worked out perfectly. Got the humpty dumpty omelet and it hit the spot! Quintessential diner experience.

Ive been coming here for over a decade and the one constant is the breakfast, which is available all day, is amazing. The pancakes &amp; omelets are a must. Busy days are on the weekends mornings. But on weekend nights and weekdays its not quite as busy but the service isnt quite as good. All and all CPD is a nice place to eat.

I was on vacation with my girlfriend and stood at the Super 8 next door and we had breakfast here everyday. ??Quick seating, great service regardless of who ever was our server! ??Oh and the food was very quick and tasty!

Pancakes are buttery and great. $3.99 deal never gets old! The line is pretty long on the weekends though, so be prepared!

I am big on breakfast food and thats all I order when I come here...and I always order the same thing: french toast, eggs and sausage. Great french toast. The place is greasy and old--from the plates to the silverware--so dont expect fine dining.  When my father visits he insists we eat breakfast here.

Closest thing to Waffle House I could find. Im an addict of this food... Good service food was on point.

So I finally took the husband there on Saturday. It was really crowded. But there were two seats at the counter... Yes they have a formica counter. The waitress was so wonderful. And she kept on calling us hon... I ordered the chip beef on toast and it was so good. Mark got french toast. The bill came to like 20 bucks TOTAL with a good 20% tip. Still liked it but only now a little better. Beats IHOP any day.

Great and cheap food. ??They have fantastic hash browns, and you cant go wrong with the 2 eggs/2bacon/2pancake deal. ??The only downside is the space -- its just one room, and it is weirdly loud. They also only have 4-person tables, so its not great for groups.

I came here this morning for breakfast because my roommate &amp; I wanted a change from Ihop. The reviews on here is what solidified our decision. On arrival we were slightly deterred by how many ppl were waiting but we figured maybe its just that good. The turnover was very quick tho &amp; we were seated after about 15/20 mins. The wait staff were very friendly and accomodating. I ordered the waffle platter with 2eggs scrambled with cheese, bacon, and added a side of grits. My roommate ordered the same except with a side of hash browns. Everything was DELICIOUS. I typically have some type of food leftover on my plate, so idk if I was that hungry or the food was just that good but I literally cleaned my plates. The only one con I have is my eggs were cooked a little harder than I like but I mix them with my grits anyway so it wasnt really an issue. One of the best waffles that Ive ever had tho. This place is definitely worth it if your looking for a delicious breakfast.

Oh my god. I just had an AMAZING experience there. The hash browns, the corned beef hash, the coffee and great service. Everything was so good and it was super cheap! I was blessed that this little place is right next to my hotel. Definitely going back there in the morning.

Well it is diner food after all.....its ok the only problem they have is the space not great for large groups...also if u have a big family its impossible to sit a family of six like mine. Personnel forgets stuff must times but the good thing is that they bring food fast.

Everything a diner should be. Cheap, fast, &amp; delicious. Probably not going to win any awards, but definitely the best breakfast place for several miles. Dont be afraid to try it just because it looks like shit when you drive by. Its definitely worth a stop in the morning.

Cheap, quick service and yummy food. This place is tiny but somehow even on graduation weekend at UM there was no wait to get a table. ??I had a Western omelete with hashbrowns (tasted super fresh) and two biscuits (delicious). ?? Huge portions. ??I could only eat half. ??My dad had to drag the plate away from me so I wouldnt gorge myself. ??  My husband got the open faced hot roast beef, which is drenched in gravy, so I would not recommend unless you are into soggy white toast. Also, if ordering the open faced roast beef, definitely consider getting some fries or another hearty side as its portion is way smaller than the breakfast fare. ??My dad got a fish sandwich which was good, but again, sides needed if you want this to be a full meal. ??Service is lightening fast and the folks are friendly. ??Seems like the typical college town hangout as there was a group of undergrads at the next booth with a table full of nothing but cheese fries and strawberry milkshakes. ??  Also super accommodating, as we got a burger and some pancakes to go and they packed up all the condiments for us in separate containers, including the whipped cream and strawberries (my son was pleased).   Downer: strawberries on the pancakes are not fresh, but considering the prices, thats not much of a complaint. ??Would go again.

Typical no frills diner, but everything that people are picky about (eggs, waffles, French toast, hash) always comes out perfectly cooked and in about 5 minutes. ??They have no staff turnover, it seems, because the same friendly faces are always serving us and cooking our food. ??I like the waffle house-style open kitchen--those women run it like a well-oiled machine. ??The portions are HUGE. ?? They also have turkey sausage and sugar-free syrup.

LOVE breakfast here! I usually get the egg &amp; bacon sandwich w/ a side of corned beef w/ green peppers &amp; onions. AMAZING!

Its a good ol fashioned diner that serves the needs of hungry students better than Plato or IHOP. The hash browns here are always nice and golden and all of the things that go into the omelets taste pretty fresh, and of course theyve got the classic diner toast and diner coffee.

Hamburger was made from frozen patties and cheap ones at that. THe soda fountain wasnt working when I was there. You only get one refill on most drinks without paying extra. The bathroom wasnt clean and the hash browns where undercooked and had no seasoning. When we went to check out the women at the register didnt say 2 words to us, but was having a heated personal discussion on the phone.

24 HOURS, 24 HOURS, 24 HOURS! It is like your mom, who can alway feed you in any hour of a day, with service. Food is OK, just OK to me, an Asian. My family like it a lot and I dont know why.  The reason I am rating 3 other than 4, is that, its food quality is not stable. I have been served well-done and rare steaks, when medium rare is always my request. Sometimes I have to look at WHO IS COOKING to decide what/how should I order.

I like this place, great alternative to the corporate machine that is Ihop (I kid). Food is greasy and simple, as to be expected from a 24/7 diner. French toast is great, but not really a fan of the pancakes. Try the liver and onions (gross in theory, but delicious in practice).

Cutest little diner! The server was really sweet and he made sure we happy. They have your typical diner food. I had pancakes, eggs, hash browns and toast. Super yummy!

Aside from the fact that 2 of the people i went warned me that the food will be horrible and not to expect much. I thought this place was pretty effin amazing. Especially for 2 oclock in the morning, when we got there.  It was a pretty random night for the 5 of us, but the food came quick and we were acting a fool for most of the night and the staff didnt seem care much. They thought we were pretty funny.   Minus 1 for the service. The waitress was mad un-interested from the jump and I was abt to get smart with her but Im bettrn then that... Anyway we tried every way possible to get a refill. It had been over 20 minutes and were sucking air from the straw.   BTdub...THE ONION RINGS ARE AMAZING!

Breakfast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ??Its a diner. Sit at the counter and watch your food being cooked and prepared. (I like that.) Busier during the school year, as University of Maryland students are included in their clientel. The coffee is really good, hot &amp; fresh. ??There is an IHOP closer to the hiway - definitely skip the IHOP because the service is awful. (45 minutes for a grilled cheese sandwich). Waitstaff at College Park Diner are cheerful and reasonably fast. Tons of parking right on Route 1.

Great small diner. The food is always awesome, prices are good, staff is friendly. I love that it is a real old time diner, where they cook your food right behind the counter. Want a good breakfast this is the place.

The best service in college park by far. Try to be served by Chris, as he is probably the best waiter there (although all are good!). Breakfast is also served all day, making it a nice place to come in the evening if youre in the mood for that.

Love late night breakfast here. Great 24 hour spot. Its more like the homecooked stuff Im used to. Yum!

I like this place. ??Hash browns are great. ??Nice size portions. ??Good service.

Good food. ??A little warm in the restaurante and service was diner like. ??The bathroom wasnt the cleanest.

CP Diner is a great place to go if youre looking to get hot food without breaking the bank. My go-to item was always The Big B which is 3eggs cooked how you like, sausage or bacon, grits or hash brown, toast or biscuit, and a juice, all for under $10 which on a students budget is not only filling but very affordable. The service is always friendly and I always receive my food within a timely manner. Try to avoid the bathroom if you can though.   I have heard a few people say negative things about this place but you have to remember its a diner, so expect diner atmosphere and diner food.

My favorite place in CP.  When I didnt feel like making breakfast, my husband knew what was next. Everything I have ordered(french toast, burgers, waffles, etc.) is pretty good and you definitely cant compete with the price. My husband and I are in love with this place, way better than ihop which wasnt that much further away. Be willing to wait on weekends though its pretty packed.  CPD you have my heart!!!!!!

4 stars for the food and 2 for the service  To be fair, there were only 3 people working the entire place. While that wasnt a big deal in the beginning, by the time we were ready to leave, they were running around so much, it was impossible to get the check. I dont know if they normally have more people working, but that would make the experience much better.  That being said, I liked the place. I got a western omelet with biscuits and hash browns and it was absolutely delicious. Right amount of spice that hit the spot. My roommate was satisfied with his omelet as well. Plus the omelets are roughly $2 cheaper than the IHOP up the street. I think we got a decent bang for our buck.  Whats cool about this place is that the kitchen is completely open to the restaurant, so if youre sitting at the bar, you can see them making your food! Its a cute little detail that gave the place a special feel. If you can, I recommend sitting at the bar for this very reason.  I will probably go back, but not until I try a bunch of other places on my list...unless Im craving breakfast food.

Best Belgium waffle in the DC area. Im going there right now!! ??On a Friday night.... for breakfast...... its that good!

This place is a complete and total dive but that is ok with me. We just finished an Ikea trip and wanted a quick place to grab a bite. The people of College Park really dont like their food choices that much since most of the Yelps in the area are quite pitiful. We headed here and the place was nearly deserted despite it being around 9:00 on a Thursday night. When we pulled in the parking lot and looked inside I looked at my friend and said, this is going to be either really good or really bad. I have a fondness for writing about bad dining experiences on Yelp but unfortunately this place didnt give me the chance to do that.   The menu is pretty comprehensive and covers just about anything you could want out of a diner. I knew I was in the right place when I looked behind the counter and the cook had about 5 lbs of bacon on the grill. Part of our mealtime discussion revolved around what in the world she intended to do with that much bacon but we could not come up with anything rational. The service was kind of spotty but there was only one college age kid running the entire floor. I had the ham, egg, and cheese sandwich and hashbrowns. Pretty good for diner food. The sig-o seemed to enjoy his Western omelet and the bestie said the Turkey Club was serviceable. My tea tasted like 4 day old mop water that someone stuck a teabag in. If you are expecting something fancy then steer clear of this place. The food is decent diner fare and reasonably priced. Perfect for the college kid on a budget with the munchies but not for the more refined palate.

I dont know if Paul D is talking about the same College Park Diner. ??I used my credit card to pay the bill, and there is no lobby. ??I dont know about an ATM on the premises. ?? ??No matter, I agree that this is a good diner if a diner is what you are looking for. ?? I am glad my GPS and its outdated maps had this place in its memory. ??We were looking specifically for a diner ??near our hotel where my son could order lunch and the rest of us could order breakfast. ??  The kids, not understanding that you dont judge a book by its cover, had serious reservations about eating in a place so small and kind of shabby looking from the outside (e.g.marquee was missing letters, none of the ambiance of the corporately owned restaurants and pseudo-diners they are used to). ??It was noisy and crowded when we arrived but we were pointed to a table right away and our coffee and teas were on the table within a few minutes. ??  It didnt take long to get our food. ??It wasnt served at one time but dishes were served close enough together that no one was eating alone for long. ?? Oldest son ordered his fries with cheese on them, something I practically lived on in high school but havent eaten in years because of the calories and the disappointing taste of cheese product a lot of places use. ??I tried a couple since his fries arrived before my western omelet and I was really hungry. ??Delicious! ??Cheddar cheese on hot crispy fries. ??I would come back to this diner (if I was in the area) just for this special treat. ?? I ordered a Western omelet with tomatoes instead of green peppers. ??Usually, I cant eat a 3-egg omelet, but this one I could not resist finishing. ??Not at all greasy, cooked well but not dry, and very flavorful.  It was a busy place, no time for chitchat with the waitress or a long discussion about about whats good on the menu, but ??the service was flawless. ??We had everything we wanted when we wanted it. ??The ??waitress knew we were first-timers, so when she saw we were about finished, she explained that the check was already up at the register and we should tell the cashier we were at table 6.   I didnt think the prices were cheap but were a good value for the money, and ??I could be out of touch with whats reasonable in that area. ??My omelet (came with grits or hash brown &amp; toast) was $9.00. ??I cant remember the other prices. ??  If our organization books the same hotel next year, we will return to the College Park Diner for more cheese fries, hoagies, french toast and omelets.

ok the ppl was so nice and friendly and helpful but that is not what made me oh so happy!!! it was the food... i had a steak and pancakes and eggs w/cheese. i was in heaven from the jump. it smelled good looked great and melted on my tongue like bliss. i just wish i could have given a bigger tip to the staff. there was two ladies cooking when i went. excellent service and food!!!!!

The good? Open 24/7.  The bad? Pretty much everything else.  While waiting for our order, I noticed a huge giant bug on the wall and well, I wanted to get up and go immediately. After receiving my entre?? (I ordered the chipped beef) I took one bite and couldnt eat any more. It was so salty and so dry, it pretty much ruined my whole experience there. ??The service wasnt that great either. After getting the food, the waiter was nowhere to be found.  I wont be returning to this place any time soon...

When it comes to that classical diner scene, CP Diner does it as good as anyone. It is open 24/7 so for a college student who is awake into those wee hours of the night, those hours of availability are crucial. The service is great and it has become a staple of my life here in college park.

Typical diner serving typical diner food. Pancakes were quite good as was the sausage. College Park isnt one of my usual haunts but if Im back in the area Id go back.

This little hole in the wall is where its at!! Im telling you, the food is good, cooked to order, and cheap...and the service is fast and friendly. ??What more can you ask for from a diner? ??My favorite is the french toast. ??If I werent concerned about potentially becomming as big as a house, Id probably go there and eat it everyday. ??This place gets 4 stars from me...only reason why it doesnt get 5 is because it does get a bit crowded on the weekends and the wait can be a little bit annoying. ??Other than that...its a winner!!

Excellent chicken salad and pancakes, too. We eat here almost every weekend. Service is friendly and fast. Food is what you would expect from a diner. Enjoy!

I have eaten here more times than I should have. Despite always coming in past 2am, and usually being completely dead when I show up, the service is extremely slow. Ive tried their burgers, which were bland, the SOS, which tasted like absolutely NOTHING, and the fries are nothing great. I think the food is overpriced for its level of quality; if they made it dirt cheap, Id probably give the place 3, maybe even 4 stars, but as it stands, this should be a 1.5. Platos is a better choice than CP Diner, no question.

My friends and I stayed in college park and ate here only once. we wanted to eat there again but the line was practically out the door.   As a new yorker i wanted to try some southern style food. i was glad the diner was able to provide that and then some. the grits were excellent. the 6 oz steak and eggs were delicious. the steak was cooked just right (i ordered medium well) and seasoned nicely.   my friends ate the pie and were in heaven. i tried a piece and it was good. i just dont have a strong sweet tooth. everything my friends ordered was liked.   next time i am visiting DC, i will make the stop off the I-95 to eat here again. I hope the jalapeno poppers are homemade.

Ive only been here once, and I guess I cant really judge too harshly since I havent been to many diners but Id definitely have to say that the CP Diner is probably lower on the ladder of eateries. My boyfriend seems to love the food here, but then again his iron-clad stomach seems to be able to handle anything remotely edible.   I would have to agree that its a pretty good for how little you pay. Other than the dingy walls and outdated decor, the food seems fairly clean and I do like how the kitchen is in the open. No funny business behind your back here! The mozzarella sticks were pretty standard, nothing special. I ordered the crab cake sandwich (which, in hindsight was probably not the wisest choice...) but either my standards were so low that it tasted fairly decent (what was I thinking?! Crabcakes at a diner?) or it was actually not bad. The eggs over-easy my boyfriend ordered were done perfectly, and his scrapple... seemed normal? (Is it supposed to be gray? And what kind of meat is scrapple?!?!)  I havent been here during a rush so Im not sure how the service is during peak hours, but it wasnt too shabby. Most importantly, the bathrooms were clean!  Basically, you get what you pay for. Not bad, not great, good for some quick cheap eats!

Breakfast here is fast, good, and cheap. Really cheap. I think their special is under four bucks. Its small and on weekends there can be a bit of a wait, but for pancakes and bacon, this place gets my vote.

grease, thick and wafting in the air? ??check. basics on the menu? check. sunny-side-up eggs not over cooked? ??check. hmmm... did i mention the grease?  hash browns were too thick and generally underdone. ??boo... corned beef hash also generally underdone--strong canned feeling kraft jam on table was not decent (do i nitpick? check.)  will only return in a couple of years if i cannot find a decent corned beef hash nearby, it does have the grease thing going for it. mmmmm... ??that, and I am rather desperate in college park.  as an aside, the wait staff was friendly, but service cannot save a 24 hour breakfast joint if the breakfast itself leaves something to be desired. ??That said, it would have otherwise been a nice bonus.

Easily my favorite diner in the area. ??I havent been to many because Im pretty faithful to the diner formerly known as Barnside. ??Its straight up diner food so its cheap, plentiful and greasy. ??If you dont like grease, keep it moving. ??If you especially dont like walking out with your hair and clothes smelling of old grease, this isnt the place for you. ??However, if you partied a little too hard and want to avoid the inevitable morning meet-up with cold porcelain, then this is your cure-all dammit! ??Proceed here after the club, let the greasy goodness permeate your innards and rest easy. ??They have pork hot links on the menu - loves it. ??French toast is served with a hunk of butter on the side - yessir. ??Country fried steak takes up the entire plate...sweet tea is available...open 24 hours...2 people can eat here for $15. ??This place is 5 star to me, but I will be totally impartial and subtract a star because I HAVE observed some diner-esque stuff here on occasion and Ill leave it at that....
