The Jumbo Jumbo Taiwanese Chicken is the bomb! I love this location because they give a lot more food compared to other locations and the service is great! The chicken is not only amazing, it has a nice kick and isnt too greasy. Jumbo jumbo also has amazing bubble tea and smoothies. The bubble comes with a whole lot of bubbles that arent too mushy, or too hard. They are perfect! Come and try the Taiwanese Chicken appetizer or entree. You wont be disappointed.  The only downside is that it might be hard to find parking. There is a garage in the back, but I would be careful about parking in the on campus lots. Make sure to read the signs so your car doesnt get towed.

This is pretty much same as Jumbo Jumbo in Rockville. The food quality is good and the service is good as well. However, only difference Ive noticed is that this location doesnt have daily specials like the one in Rockville. But we always get the taiwanese chicken with rice dish and beef noodle soup. The boba tea is decent too, but we drive extra miles to get KungFu tea :)

Do the kids at UMD realize how good theyve got it these days? Air-conditioning in dorms, new buildings on campus, and Jumbo Jumbo for bubble tea literally two lanes across from campus.   Considering that this Jumbo Jumbo is located in a prime position diagonally across the Art-Socy building and across from Lot 1, it gets a lot of foot traffic every day since it opened. Ive been here at least a couple times per month since it opens, and yes I make the 25-30 minute drive from Howard County to get bubble tea at Jumbo Jumbo because its that good.   If youve been to the two other Jumbo Jumbo Cafe locations in Rockville, then this one has the same menu of bubble teas and Taiwanese-style appetizers and traditional meals. Eating at any Jumbo Jumbo location makes me happy because its exactly what I expect when I crave Taiwanese home-style comfort food.   For appetizers, my favorites are the Taiwanese chicken or fried tofu spiced with salt and basil, since it pretty much tastes like what you would get at a Taiwanese night market. My favorite full meal to order is the Taiwanese chicken with ground pork on rice (also comes with a small side of pickled cabbage/carrots); but I also like the Spicy Pepper Pork on Rice and Beef Noodle Soup. The only miss is the Thai Spicy Chicken with Rice, which tastes like awful American Chinese takeout  Service is usually ok, sometimes they can be a little slow on weekends, especially if a large group of students show up.

It completely surprised me when I spotted a new set of stores peeking out past Lot 1! When did this happen? But it was fate - we were coming from UMs Taiwanese night market and I was still in the mood for boba and fried chicken!  I ordered a house black tea with boba, which is a classic and usually a good way to judge the quality of a new place. The tea itself was some of the best Ive had - bold tea flavor, perfect level of sweetness, and creamy with no signs of grainy powder. The boba were mediocre. They were on the border of too-firm, but their real flaw was flavor, or really, lack thereof. They werent particularly sweet. At least having them with the tea provided some balance, but I like a slightly softer and sweeter tapioca pearl.   We split a fried combo appetizer, which is a big pile of fried chicken, tofu, and squid balls. The chicken and squid are seasoned with the traditional Taiwanese seasoning blend, which is magically salty and spicy and with that hint of 5-spice that tingles on your tongue. The tofu tasted like... nothing. I dont know how it dodged all seasoning but it was flavorless and boring - especially compared to the other two elements. Taiwanese fried chicken is blissful, so I didnt mind ignoring the tofu in favor of magic chicken bites.   Service was friendly and prompt. Prices were reasonable for what we got and compared to other places in the area. Our two medium teas were huge (and yet somehow theres an even larger bucket-like size) and the appetizer was towering. All of that was $18.   Ten Ren still runs the boba game in CP, but Jumbo Jumbo serves food thats 1000% better than Ten Rens. Itll be interesting when Kung Fu Tea opens and we have a real competitive market!

Good quality bubble tea. I ordered the milk tea with the honeydew melon flavoring along with the bubbles. I am a light ice type of gal and can appreciate that they didnt fill my entire cup up with ice to give me a lesser amount of actual tea (as some of their competitors do). The tea came out super fast too and the staff were friendly! One of the perks of attending UMD is the amount and variety of amenities we have throughout and on the outskirts of campus. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that they charge a $0.30 fee to use a credit card (for purchases under $10) and then the didnt serve Thai tea (but Im assuming its because theyre Taiwanese here?) Lol, oops!

This location does not have as many food options or nearly enough seats to accommodate the sea of hungry college students that fills this place around lunch time. Other than that, I dont find that to be an issue because I still get to have my usuals. Yes, I said usuals because most of my money goes to Jumbo Jumbo to fuel my bubble tea addiction.  Here are some food options I like to get: the BBQ Chicken on Rice, the Pork chop on Rice, Seafood Udon Noodle Sauteed, Tofu Basil in Ginger Sauce.  The boba is consistently tasty and the right amount of chewiness! My main reason for loving Jumbo Jumbo.   Some bubble tea options I love: Mango + Peach Black Tea Mango + Passion Fruit Black Tea Taro Milk Tea Winter melon Milk Passion fruit Slush Lychee Slush (anything but the loverfruit! never get the loverfruit)

Decent bubble tea for a normal price. Not sure about the food. Credit minimum fee gives me a bit of an eye roll.

Spoiler Alert:  This is a teaser and a cheat of a review.  *****  Jumbo Jumbo is a Taiwanese bubble place that also serves Taiwanese food.  Taiwanese bubble tea joints are two headed creatures.  There is the bubble tea itself - which is nearly always good.  Then there is the Taiwanese food - which can range from gourmet to godawful.  I have been to some Taiwanese joints where I had to wipe down the food with Kleenex before I ate it to get the grease off.  But then the finest meal I had in Singapore was a bowl of Taiwanese soup.   So I go to Jumbo Jumbo and get a Chocolate Bubble Tea with red beans.  The bubble tea is wonderful - but then bubble tea is nearly always wonderful.  As for the food .. which is the critical question..........  ******  (Told you it was a teaser review. I didnt order any.)  ******  But the place was jam-packed full of Taiwanese and Chinese students, and THEY were all ordering food.  Draw your own conclusion.

4 stars for their Taiwanese fried chicken, amd 3.5 stars for their boba. I have tried their boba multiple times and I sometimes love it, sometimes hate it. Who knows if it is because of the flavor I choose or if it is because on the day I come?   Their fried chicken comes in a bag with skewers and is like popcorn style fried chicken pieces. Be careful, since the pieces are bite sized it is incredibly dangerous because you can inhale a bag relatively quickly. I got a large order to share but since the bag was directly in front of me I am ashamed to say I consumed most of it... the breading on the chicken is a bit salty, which I love. The little bites of super saltiness really make it addictive.   I have tried their taro milk tea, their coffee milk tea, almond milk tea, and honey dew. Ratings for each are:  Taro - 4/5 Coffee - 2/5 Almond - 3/5 Honey dew - 2/5  When I come back, I think I would stick to the taro and chicken.

I never tried the food here but from the sight of it, didnt look very appetizing to me. I have however had there bubble tea on multiple occasions. Its not the best bubble tea in town but this place is located very conveniently within the campus, on the way home and hence I walk into their place once in a while. The price is a little high compared to the size and quality of the drinks. Ive had taller cups of bubble tea with more intricate flavors and better customization at other places for cheaper prices. They have rather flat, monotonic flavors and they dont ask for your preference of sweetness levels. I have tried Lychee, winter melon and chocolate flavors. They taste fine. I will keep visiting once in a while and bring my friends to sit and hangout. But thats primarily owing to the location.

Ive been to the Rockville location many times. I was hoping that this place shared the same great food as the main location. Im proud to say it does! We ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the fried chicken with pork over rice. The beef in the soup you could tell had been marinated for hours. Broth had a rich stew broth and large chunks of boneless beef chucks were a nice added touch. You could taste the star anise and Sichuan peppercorns in the broth. The fried pork had the spicy ginger flavor and the sweet potato starch gave it that popcorn authentic taste. This is probably the best Asian fusion spot around CP. Food is not greasy, service is quick, prices are reasonably. Ill be back to try some of their Taiwanese buns and tomato chicken over rice dish. There is a $10 minimum on credit card and seating is best for small parties under 6.

Ive been waiting for months for this place to open-- I finally dont have to go all the way to Rockville for my Taiwanese comfort food! The menu here is definitely abbreviated compared to the two main locations, but it has the main things you need: the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, beef noodle soup and bubble tea (green milk tea all the way!). Those are all definitely on point. I really like that if you get takeout, they put the chicken in a little bucket instead of the bag like in the Rockville locations, which keeps it from getting soggy. The beef noodle soup is also well-packaged, with the noodles and soup/beef separated and in its own paper bag (to help keep it upright and avoid spillage). Ill admit the Taiwanese lo mein was not as good as Im used to-- I found it more bland and a big heavier on the meat than usual-- but Ill see how they do since they just opened a few weeks ago, right before the big snowstorm.   Im hoping that with this place opening and Kung Fu Tea arriving soon, theyll give Ten Ren a jolt so it stops charging such ridiculous prices for its teas (especially that tiny small size).

Dang, Danny Q. has been sipping on gallons of Haterade and not bubble tea. He might lighten up a bit after having some sweetened tea and little black (tapioca) balls in his mouth. (As of 2/10, Danny Q.s review is gone!)  We had a big group fresh out of a 3.5-hour class over in Van Munching-- all freezing cold, hungry, and thirsty AF (should probably start using parched and not thirsty). We had a bunch of orders, all of which came out in a timely manner without any screw ups. I think thats doing pretty well for soft opening. Theyre definitely understaffed, so pick up a job application!  Ordered the usual- beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken w/ rice, and bubble tea. Pretty consistent with what theyre serving back in Rockville, land of AZNs. Not really premier culinary stuff, but hey, thats not what theyre going for. Its Taiwanese comfort food, so let it be, let it beeeeee.

Good location and the food is okay...all in all, not a bad Asian food option in CP. I stopped by on a Friday night with a bunch of friends (we were a group of 8 or 9) less than an hour before closing. Interior is pretty simple and makes good use of space; there are plenty of tables for small groups and room for lining up to order at the counter. Menus are taped to the front window/door and stacked near the entrance.  The menu is pretty standard, although I think there might be fewer dish options here than at the other locations. My bf and I decided on a passion fruit milk tea, the famous Taiwanese popcorn chicken (as an appetizer), and a rice with pork dish. They were out of bubbles for milk tea, which was unfortunate but not entirely unexpected given the late hour and new-ness of the place. They did have pudding and jelly available though! Our friends ordered various milk tea drinks and some food.  Took a while for all of us to get our orders; they ended up forgetting one friends order, and he didnt get his food until right before closing. But since we were such a huge group, and there was only one guy manning the whole place (cashier, bringing out food, etc.), I think Ill let it slide.  Food itself was alright? My passionfruit milk tea was on point (sweet and tart and milky without the powdery taste), and the popcorn chicken was the perfect texture, but it lacked seasoning oomph. More five spice and fried basil please! Our pork and rice dish was covered in a brown, meaty sauce - solid Asian comfort food but nothing special. Our friends agreed that most of their food was kinda bland and just...okay. But hey, we were hungry and its convenient and not too expensive, so Im not complaining.  Obviously theyve got stuff to improve on, but I think its a great addition to the area. Check it out! :]

We were at UMD for a concert so looked up a place for a quick bite beforehand. ??Jumbo Jumbo Cafe looked just the job. ??It was; my husband had a spicy beef dish he really enjoyed, but mine was less exciting. ??Sorry to say. ??After ordering the Tomato Chicken with rice, my husband read a review by another suggesting to avoid anything with tomato in the name unless you enjoyed glop. ??I have to concur. ??Too late for me since Id placed my order, but for the record, dont order anything with tomato in the name unless you enjoy glop. ??Before my dish arrived, I had considered that that one reviewer might have different standards and opinions as to what glop is....but seems he and I are on the same page on that one.

The Taiwanese chicken is good. Its crispy and good price.  The bubble tea is the best one I ever tried. Its right sweetness and it smells good. Love it! Take out order always on time and friendly.

While there are at least 20 items on the menu board, this place, in my opinion, makes only two tasty dishes - Taiwanese chicken (dark meat) with pork on rice and Crispy Asian chicken (white meat) with pork on rice.   Having tried the majority of the Traditional Meals and some of the noodles, those two are foolproof in youre in the mood for some greasy fried chicken and rice. The dry bean curd with pork is rather bland; shrimp in lobster sauce is very bland and beef noodle soup is mostly noodles with small pieces of tough meat. I noticed in the summer, perhaps due to less customers, the rice served here is reheated from the previous day. They should know better than to serve that -- many of their clients are of Asian ancestry and know freshly cooked rice from a dry scoop of carb. The fried tofu and squid ball as appetizers are very salty so beware.   Service is spotty depending on whos working.   Overall, come for the two mentioned dishes. They do those well.

If Im on campus and having lunch, this is the place youll find me. Like other Yelpers, Id recommend the Taiwanese chicken with the pork and rice. Its both delicious and a huge portion for the price. You can definitely take the leftovers to go and get a second meal out of it. Given the spot of campus it would be nice if they had some wifi (I couldnt pick up the campus network but maybe that was just a quirk). All around, though, highly recommend as your campus lunch spot.

Had the jasmine green milk tea with boba: taste was phenomenal. Not very sweet, just the way I like it.   Order came up very quick. Although I didnt get food, I sure would like to come back some day and do so. Their fried [popcorn style] chicken looked great!  I knock off 1 star because I am not a UMD student, had no parking pass to park at any of the many nearby spaces. A short walk away is a big lot with a few metered spots; $3 for 30 minutes [can pay with credit card though, eh] is robbery. Free parking in most campus lots after 4pm though, fyi.  Note orders under $10 are subject to a 30 cent surcharge if you use credit card.

Open one in DC please!! I normally frequent the Rockville location but found a Groupon for the College Park location so I figured I would give it a shot. The menu isnt as expansive as the Rockville one but they still have the classics. This time I ordered the Taiwanese fried chicken (an absolute must!), fried green beans, and fried tofu. All were good portions and delicious. I also got the yogurt milk tea with boba- the boba was made perfectly. And they made mine 1/4 sweet just like I like it. It was still sweet but not sickly so. They also have Taiwanese shaved ice here, served in massive portions (definitely meant for sharing). Another big plus for this location- the staff at the counter was super friendly. None of the surliness I am used to from the Rockville location. If in the area would definitely recommend. I also dropped by ten ren nearby but the food options are significantly better here.

Location is convenient since its right next to lot 1 on campus. The place itself is small and when it gets crowded, theres no room to walk and there arent enough tables to seat the majority of the people people there.  Would rate this place 3 stars but this girl who works there, Crystal, makes it 5 stars.

Since its opened, going to Jumbo Jumbo has become a regular thing for me. Definitely better than Ten Rens on Route 1. I like the coffee milk tea so I always get that, but the jasmine green tea is also good. The smalls are really big. Ive tried the Taiwanese fried chicken, chicken noodle soup (I dont really eat red meat but people I know who have tried the beef noodle soup say its really good), and the pork and rice meal. Overall - would recommend if youre in the area and you generally like Asian food, and would recommend over the chain casual restaurants (like Ten Rens, Chipotle, Noodles &amp; Co, etc) in College Park.

Jumbo Jumbo has always been a favorite so I was extremely excited when one in CP opened. They havent yet had their grand opening yet so this review is only based on their soft opening.   They still have a few kinks to work out. For example, there needs to be some kind of quality control as they are training new employees. I got a passion fruit bubble tea once and there was still a layer of syrup at the bottom of the cup. There was a new employee being trained but the more seasoned employees should be required to check on the bubble teas before they are served.   The employees seem to be very rushed sometimes. One server dropped a piece of chicken onto the table when serving the food because he was rushing to place it down. But overall, the servers are relatively friendly still.   Also, the Taiwanese chicken and beef noodle soup are delicious! If you get the Taiwanese chicken, I suggest getting the take out version because you get more food (from what Ive experienced, at least). If you get the Taiwanese chicken and rice taken out, the chicken will get a bit soggy because of the steam trapped in the take-out container.

Pretty good Taiwanese food selection! Theyre boba is legit compared to the garbage they serve at Kung fu tea! They dont skimp you with a ton of ice like other places. Great place to hang out and chill.

Honestly my favorite place to eat in college park! Amazing bubble tea and tasty Taiwanese good as well. Im a regular customer. Perfect for any occasion.

Taiwanese chicken is the best thing on the menu, cause its most value aka most bang for your buck. And crystal, the server... She carries this entire franchise on her back. Shes amazing. Beautiful. Smart. Funny. And the way your bubble tea tastes after she makes it.... Mmmmm, you can just tell its made with love. *sigh* Shes the perfect woman. Crystal, I still love you please come back home

Service is fast and nice staffs. Compared to another branch in Rockville, here food flavor is kind of average. We ordered fried salty and pepper pork chop and a beef stew noodle soup. It came with a big amount which makes everyone happy!

Had the jumbo sized house black tea with bubbles. It was tasty as I hoped. Will get charged extra if total is less than $10 and you want to pay card. Place looked clean. Thumbs up.

Terrible bubble tea with overcooked tapioca. Their red bean tea isnt even strained and there are bits of the bean in the tea.

The passionfruit green bubble tea was good, I probably would get it again since I live close by but the one at Kung Fu Tea is much better. The starfruit green tea disappointed me as it was very bland and not very much like starfruit. Overall, I think they could benefit from more varieties of flavored teas and perhaps higher quality syrups.

The food is okay and so is the bubble tea. The green tea has a strong flowery taste that almost tastes a little artificial. Overall the place is average. I do have one complaint: i ordered the ground pork with rice I i barely got any ground pork. They should be a little more generous with some of their portions.

Horrible service. Waited 20 mins for a drink. Noticed that a few people who ordered before me got their drinks already. I went to check and found out the person forgot to make my order. Once he did make my order, he made it wrong. The drink itself was subpar. Too sweet and too much milk. If you are expecting the quality of the milk tea to be like the Rockville location dont bother coming.

The bubble tea here is great! Just a heads up, they dont have Thai Tea here.
