Best burrito Ive ever had, so delicious. My friend loved the chicken tacos. Great prices, too.

Had I just had the steak and rice, this would been a four (beaming) star review, but I also had some pupusas and tacos too. The curdito was tasty, but they didnt want to give me the red hot sauce for those dry, tasteless pupusas. The tacos were okay and needed what I decided was Srichacha.

Super delicious pupusas! ??Not made in a Mexican restaurant. ??Salvadoran 100%. ??I first discovered pupusas in Salt Lake City many years ago in a family owned place right next to where I lived. ??I never thought Id see them as good as that. ??These are that good! ??Hit this place up for your pupusa fix.

Yelp failed me. Got papusas and chicken taco and fajita. We were disappointed with lack of flavor. ?? Odd setup also. You have to squeeze between people eating at the counter to order. Then squeeze back in to pick up your order and then go back and squeeze back in at the end to pay. Fajitas were expensive too. Never been disappointed with a place that had 4.5 stars before.

Yummy and super cheap. Little hole in the wall. Ordered the quesadilla and some Pupusas. Really hit the spot. You watchthem make your food from scratch. Pupusas were huge. Quesadillas are hard to mess up and they didnt disappoint. Husband wasnt as partial to the horchata. Just different from the Mexican version we were used to in SoCal.

Love Nellys - food is delicious and affordable, and you only have to tell them once which kind of tortillas you like (thin ones or the fat handmade ones), and they dont forget - every time you come in after, they give you the ones that are your favorite - talk about love. :) ??Weve had the carne guisada (my favorite in chilly weather), pupusas, corn tamale, tacos... its all good.  It is a very local place, and seems like it feels like family for local Salvadore??os/as. ??I have always been served in order of arrival, and I am not Latina (though the ladies behind the counter patiently let me practice my sorry Spanish when I place my order). ??People thinking they were served after locals may have mistaken someone who placed a phone order in advance for someone jumping the line. ??Love the ladies who work the kitchen. ??They run that show. :)

If there is one bad thing about Nellys is that if youre not El Salvadorian, you may feel out of place. ??The locals know exactly what Nellys is. ??I just picked up a Pupusa and a order of chicken tamales while I waiting for my laundry next door. ??The food was pretty darn awesome and only took minutes to prepare. ??The price was affordable, so if I am in the area, I will definitely go back.

Had a chicken taco, beef taco, and chicken pupusa. All were very good. The place is definitely a local hangout. Everyone that came in knew each other and also the ladies working. As mentioned in a previous review, they seemed to serve their regulars before a stranger like me. So, pack your patience. Overall I waited about 20-25 minutes before my food was ready. Besides that, the prices are very reasonable and the employees are friendly. Its worth a try. I plan to return.

Friendly, fast service! Really yummy pupusas- I think they use a different type of cheese. It oozes, bubbles, and gets crispy. I havent ordered anything else but judging by the number of pupusas I see them preparing, my guess is thats theyre specialty. ??This place is awesome! ??Delicioso...

Just moved to the area and really wanted pupusas. Checked on Yelp and read other reviews about the place. People seemed to love it so I decided to check it out during my break.  I ordered 3 pupusas and an Horchata. My co-worker ordered wings and fries. Both orders were gross. At first bite, the pupusas were very bland, I even used extra sauce to give it more flavor. When I got to the 3rd pupusa, I saw something stick out of the side. Looked closer and it was a pork nerve. Double gross. I feel sick to my stomach. As far as the horchata goes, I wish I never tried it. It has a really bad after taste. co-workers fries were cold and the wings had no flavor.   I definitely dont recommend this place. Usually, places that look beat up have bomb ass food. Not the case with this place.

The Food and Prices are good but be prepared for you to be served last they make sure they serve the neighborhood people they kno first

This place is fresh, delicious, and unassuming. I got the pupusas, which are just cheesy pockets of goodness with a super affordable price. ??We also got the chicken tacos and the wings for my son. It is very clean and friendly. Not the best ambience, but if you want good food and a quiet place to sit, this is it.

Nellys is very homey and you can see them prepare your food for you. The workers are very nice and friendly. If you dont know what drinks to get, they let you try!   They give you big portions for fair prices. I get pupusas every time with my food and they never disappoint!

Since I found this place it became one of my favorite places for a good home made meal; super friendly staff, they cook your food right after you order in front of you, I tried the Carne deshilada, I was in heaven; delicious taste that transported me to my little country right away, everything taste just like home !

I visited this establishment on a sunny Saturday evening for a filling, wallet-friendly, healthy dinner. The meal was this an more. Delicious, fresh, home-cooked style, Salvadorian food.  I ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas. It was tastier than Chipotle - it came with homemade corn tortilas, grilled chicken, tomato salsa, and a huge slice of avocado. It was very filling. I appreciate food being made after it was ordered.  I love how the ladies working here are happy folks. They sang as they worked.  I also like how there were little touches of Salvadorian culture, such as home made curtains, hand-drawn tip jar, framed portraits, a blaring tv, and plastic floral arrangements on tables.   As I was about to leave it was approaching peak dinner time ~6pm and it there was a bit of a line of folks waiting for their take out orders.

Great homemade Salvadoran cuisine! It was amazing to see your tortillas being made right in front of you as you wait! The meats were cooked perfectly as were the beans and rice. The only potential downside are the loud next door neighbors but the TouchTunes jukebox made up for it with a wide selection of Latin and non-Latin records. Definitely come for the food or do take-out, either way, stop by!

Awesome homemade food! The tacos and pupusas are the best. Friendly staff and good prices. Highly recommended being Hispanic myself its like being back home.

Truly authentic Salvadoran food. I thought I was at my moms house when I had the Desayuno Salvadoreno. It was hard to find as their sign was hidden. I just wished they had one by my house in Northern Virginia. I would highly recommend this place for real delicious food!

Inexpensive, tasty, fresh, hand-made pupusas! The chicken tamale was like buttah. Good Salvadoran pupusas with tasty slaw. The chicken burrito was huge and tasty. My Spanish wasnt very good so instead of 6 pupusas, we ended up with, like, 12. I happily paid for them and we had the rest for dinner the next night. Yum!

Love Latin food and this place did not disappoint. Delicious food and huge quantities. Also a big fan of the fact that you can watch your food being cooked from the time you order it. I will gladly wait for a freshly prepared meal. Great experience!

Great food, great prices, parking is a challenge but worth it. I recommend the streetb for parking. Try the mexican hot chocolate(has cayenne pepper)

The food is alright, ??but expected better based on other reviews. The place itself is kind of a hole in the wall... my beef soup gad little beef and mostly cartlidge. The fajitas were decent, ??with tender beef. I thought those items were overpriced for what I got. Next time will try the $5 burritos.

Just went there for lunch and was blown away. As a vegetarian, there are only a handful of options, but its all amazing. I got 2 corn tamales and a side of beans(all for around $4) ??and although simple, it was really well done. Everything is homemade, and when you walk in, youll see pupusas made right in front of you, which I thought was pretty cool. Service is great and theyre pretty quick with your order...also, theyre super cheap! So if youre in the area, Id definitely check the, out.

The food there is cheap and absolutely delicious! I am not sure if its mexican or salvadorian food, but there is a nice selection. Fresh ingredients and excellent seasonings. Its a hole-in-the-wall kind of establishment but I have loved it ever since a relative introduced me to it. Thought I should mention, a lot of the customers that stop by there are some what inebriated but that makes the experience all the more interesting especially around lunchtime. :)

Salvadorian food. No one speaks english, but theyll figure out what you want. All freshly prepared, very simple, delicious food. The best cheese papusa on the east coast, 2 for 3$, and try the meat ones (no idea what kind of meat) too (just suck the grease up with a napkin.) Really good burritos for 5$, fresh avocado, and ask for it spicy and get some pickled peppers. The steaks the best.  The coleslaw stuff in the bag you get with the papusas is very strange, but edible.  All in all this place is an amazing find, great, cheap, fresh food, and friendly (but foreign) staff.

Wow! My husband and I were super impressed with the food at this great El Salvadorean mom and pop restaurant. Dont be fooled by the laid back facade, this is some great El Salvadorean home cooking. And the owners are incredibly welcoming. This is one of our favorite places now! And a great place for take-out. Just be a little patient or call ahead. Good home cooking can take just a little bit of time depending on the dish.
