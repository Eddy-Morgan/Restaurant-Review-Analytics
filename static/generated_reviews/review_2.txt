Im obsessed with this place, which I stumbled upon by accident while waiting for an Uber driver to return my keys that Id left in his car (this is sadly becoming a regular--and sober--occurrence, but I digress).   They have every board game you can think of (and a lot more youve probably never even heard of). The knowledgable game gurus are happy to recommend a game for you, as well as walk you thru all the steps, so you dont have to waste time reading and rereading (and rereading again) trying to figure out how the heck everything works (looking at you, Dominion).   The food is decent, the beer selection is pretty legit, and they also have a pretty good supply of coffee and teas for when you need a caffeine fix. ??  I would spend a lot more time/money here if I lived closer, but its worth the drive!

What a cool concept!!! Board games, food, coffee, or BREW! I honestly wish I lived closer so I could visit more often.  There is ample space, a great menu, helpful staff, and its an overall fun environment.  The coolest part about B&amp;B is the cold brew coffee! Its delicious and you can get growler fills of it for only 6$! So buy yourself a growler and fill er up!  For the board games you can pay a fee for unlimited games (which staff will put away for you when you are finished) or you can pay a smaller fee for just card games.

Dine in or take out? Was the first question we were asked after being greeted at the door.  Dine in, of course!  Playing, or just eating?  Playing, of course!   Pick a seat, someone will find you.  I cant imagine ordering food to go from this place. The menu is fine, and filled with options, some better than others. Its just that the charm of this particular cafe is not the food or the drinks. It is the atmosphere.  There are a few comfy couches with low tables. These are surrounded by sensible square tables ready to be arranged for your group of gamers. Because it is all about the games.   The tables wind around shelves of board games that are arranged alphabetically. You made get find a few childhood classics, but Milton Bradley is not the focus here. Board and Brew is the spot for the serious tabletop player, with some games needing almost an hour of setup before play can even begin.   Access to the collection of games (in the hundreds) can be had for $5 per person. They have special prices for morning and weekend play, and they host tournaments in the evenings. No matter when you visit you will be surrounded by people who are as passionate about tabletop gaming as you might be.   Get ready to order a few cups of tasty coffee, a plate or two of food, and a stack of games.   Skip the appetizers, breakfast is tasty and is served all day, pastries are always a good choice. Im a fan of the chili at lunch.

I really wanted to like this place, but I was so disgusted by the amount of flies and gnats flying all over my face and food during my dinner. Im usually not picky about my food and I rarely complain about the cleanliness of a place, but I was just so annoyed that every time I put my food on the plate I had to swat the bugs away. Eventually they were landing on my face too. I dont know if this happened because I was in the corner table or what.. but I definitely did not enjoy the experience. ?? I got a chicken panini, which was okay. The sweet potato fries were good too and I liked the dipping sauce, but I had a hard time talking and eating at this place because I was so focused on getting rid of the bugs from my personal space...

Great place with great food and they do a good job having people explain different board games to groups. The place has been crowded and lively every time I have visited.

I really like this place and like to take friends here for game nights.  Its only $5 for unlimited games which is awesome.   The service is always attentive and friendly. They never seem to have a problem with the endless questions I ask or the tons of napkins I need for knocking over water.  Which happens a lot more than youd think with my friends.   Stick to their small plates! Fried pickles, sweet potato fries, reg fries, all okay.  Their burgers and sandwiches are meh. Learned my lesson with the Brew Burger and BBQ beef sandwich.   Their blueberry muffin is tasty and so is the creamsicle (?) coffee. Their caramel latte was okay. But everything is like straight super and whipped cream.

Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon. For $5/person, you can play unlimited games from their massive library, which is a great deal. We stayed for about 90 minutes to have a drink and try out some new games. The place was lively but not overcrowded, and the service was good. They also have unused copies of some games available for purchase. If we lived closer, wed be here all the time.

What a great place, with a fresh concept of diverse, high quality, complete board games. The catch is that it costs $5 per person to play unlimited games. This is steep if youre just popping in, but for a full night of boardgame play its a great deal.  That $5 gets you not unlimited board (or card) games with all the pieces, which doesnt usually happen at free-play places. They are maintained by the staff.   Also, more importantly, you get a lesson on game play with a designated Game Guru. His name was Sam and he was an encyclopedia of knowledge on every game. He also took a good 15-20 minutes to guide our group through gameplay on not one, but three games that we enjoyed. He also suggested games appropriate for our group (Dixit, Guns N Cash, and Sherriff of Nottingham). It was a great night.   As for food, beer, and coffee, there is a shitload of each. Beer is mostly local-ish (regional breweries), in bottles only. There was about a trillion coffees on the menu as well as some excellent appetizers.   Id call this place a big win, and I sure hope they do well. Ill Definitely be back.

For our after meal tea &amp; coffee, we non-schlep a couple of hundred steps &amp; viola I was entering The Board and Brew for the first time...shall not be my last by far.   You cant help but to fully relax when you step inside due to the ambience of a coffee shop, a game room, library, bakery shop &amp; earth tone colors through out. My quick scan saw comfy couches, lounge chairs, pillows &amp; of course various tables to play games on. ??The majority of the crowd seemed to be of the studious millenniums doing their homework or having study sessions.   For their concept &amp; never being here before, I anticipated the noise level to be loud &amp; distracting while conversing in an intimate space, yet it was totally the opposite. The atmosphere was engaging while in dialogue amongst ourselves &amp; people watching &amp; not eavesdropping. Who needs game night at someones home, for some pocket change you can play all the board games your gaming heart desire, as they offer over 500 games to choose from.   Aside from their speciality drinks &amp; coffees amass, they do offer bakery items &amp; desserts, with a small selection of Breakfast items. I had a specialized Steamer that consisted of Peppermint &amp; Caramel, &amp; it was delish. I enjoyed sipping out of their jumbo size coffee/tea cups.   Jonny Tsunami was our Server, &amp; all I can say is that he emanated his unique personality of a kind storm into his serving skills, that truly enhanced our visit.

The place has pretty impressive selection of games, as well as beers (bottles). For $5 per person, you get to play as much as you want! The menu is pretty diverse - salads, sandwiches, small plates(onion rings, fries etc.) breakfasts and desserts. Prices pretty fair.  I took the portobello panini with caesar salad on the side (~$9). The panini was really really good! but very small, so I was a bit disappointed. I also took a great beer ($6), double bock (i forgot the name!) that was really good.  And above all, I would like to mention that the servers were super nice and helpful, both with serving us on table, and with helping us choosing a game.

The Board and Brew provides a delightful experience! I will happily return over and over again. What is so special, you may ask. Please, let me share:  The Board and Brew has an extremely comfortable interior that provides your choice of your traditional tables and chairs or couches and coffee tables. The lighting is warm and friendly, without being either too dark or so bright as to hurt the eyes. The noise level of your fellow customers is at a very pleasant conversational hum that allows you to feel out and about, but not smothered by the weight of urban humanity.   Each dish is well prepared and presented. There is no need to worry about dainty portions being swallowed by huge plates. Everything is well proportioned to maximize your pleasure without making you feel like a glutton.   The drinks.... Locally crafted brews to tea or coffee specialties made by people that care.   Dont forget the Board. For a small fee you and your friends can play any of the hundreds of games that they have lining their shelves. Play an old favorite or find a new one, all you need is a desire to enjoy, and at The Board and Brew you will.

I love the concept of the Board &amp; Brew. Got a group of friends and cant think of anything to do? Well, this is a great option for a game night or an activity to pass time by. For only $5/per person you have access to hundreds of board games with no time limit. On top of that they have pretty good food. I recommend their Kyles Green Egg and Hamburger along with their Nutella Milkshake! Yup, thats right I said Nutella and its definitely my favorite! Although, it is kind of pricey for a milkshake. Their Old Bay Fries are good but on the saltier side. The place can be packed &amp; loud, especially at night on the weekends. But great atmosphere and the staff are really kind and accommodating. I will be back here for sure!

I LOVE THIS PLACE.   If I had time I would go twice a week. I love that they constantly get new games and that they have over 600 games. Its like hanging out at a college dorm or someones living room. It almost gives me a boy meets world vibe hanging there.   The other perks, they have beer and wine as well as food and coffee. This is a legit cafe but on the weekends it is full of amazing people laughing joking and playing games.   There is also an in house employee who will teach you how to play the games if you are confused. No more taking 40 min to set up a new game and getting in arguments during play of how to enforce the rules. It makes playing new games so much easier.   I love this place and I really hope they open a few franchises in other parts of the city. This is a great idea.

Sadly I have to rate this cafe a 2. Heres why. Upon being greeted by the owner and seated we waited 2 hours...yes two hours for our food. We were having fun with the kids playing one of the games until we notice everyone who came in after us had eaten and gone! ??We calmly asked about it and the waiter apologized and said hed get our bill taken care of. Great food was then served and then The bill came...with only 10% taken off! ??After asking to speak with the manager about this the manager sent the same waiter out with a $40 gift card...we still had to pay. No personal apology. What, really? And the owner continued to do his dallying...

Delivery service through Eat24 was great but I wish I could say the same about the food. No option to get sweet potato fries in my order and meat was way too rare for my taste. Otherwise when I have visited the actual restaurant I had a good time and the food was better when I ate in.

This place is AWESOME! Hooow did I not know about it before?! Thank god for Yelps Hidden Gems because this was the third location and Im so glad I dragged myself out of bed for it! Its the perfect low key place to grab a bite, sit and study, relax with your friend and of course, play board games!! $5pp for an unlimited amount of gaming. They have an unbelievable collection of games to choose from, and my personal favorite thing, plenty of people to teach you how to play. In fact, we met Brandon, whose whole job was it to teach people how to play and he was excellent in teaching us. Patrick also taught us how to play Splendor, a games thats been sitting unwrapped on our shelf for a while, and now we play almost every day!  Furthermore, the food was also great! I really enjoyed the fried pickles. It was my first time having them and I was really curious how they were going to taste, but they were so crunchy and not overwhelmingly sour. The Old Bay fries were really as good as everyone says they are. Crunchy, soft on the inside and full of flavor. The fiance also had a burger which was pretty delicious as well. The mocha was very rich and flavorful, but I thought the caramel Latte was a little on the watery side. I enjoyed the little patterns they made into the foam.  The seating arrangement is spacious and perfect for spreading out with games. I will definitely be back here for a day of gaming!

They have amazing coffees and a great collection of games. I went there with my girlfriend and werent going to stay for long so we didnt play any games, but I could see all of the lost popular ones in the collection. And there were so many people playing board games there. I was a little disappointed we couldnt stay for longer.

Went to this place on a weeknight and found parking in the back of the building in what seemed to be a shared parking area with Varsity apartments and other spots within the block. It was a parking garage with some spots. You park your car; remember your parking spot and then walk to a nearby machine. You have to enter your parking space number and pay the machine based on the estimated time you think you will be there (it accepted cash, coins and credit card). Once paid, you can then head to your destination.  In this cafe, I ordered some hot chocolate, which was just basic and also got some sweet potato fries (came with its own sauce) and an order of soft pretzel bites (with sauce). The pretzel bites with the sauce was actually pretty good - soft and quite tasty. The sweet potato fries were hot, so I had to wait for it to cool down before eating it and when I did, it was good as well.  As I sat with a few friends enjoying my bites, one of the owners came over and introduced himself and told a little about the place. I thought that was nice of him and I also got to know a little more about The Board and Brew as well. It is in a perfect location - right next to the University (UMCP) and also a spot for gamers to play all sorts of games (the non-electronic kind). They certainly made the place comfortable for folks in providing couches as well.  Tip Cost for parking in the garage is 15 cents for 15 minutes; $1 per hour for the first 2 hours; $14 for max time of 8 hours and it is available 24 hours/day and 7 days/week.

I came here for breakfast on a Friday morning around 9am. Predictably the place was pretty empty. Too early for most college kids! I was greeted when I entered and was offered a seat anywhere. I chose a table instead of one of the comfy sofas or chairs. A waiter brought me a menu and explained about the fancy pour over coffees. I stuck with an espresso, chocolate croissant, and the 2 egg breakfast platter. The eggs were a little overdone but other than that, it was a good meal.  Parking was plentiful in the paid lot behind the building. Only $1/hr so cant complain too much.  This can be a quiet place to work (free wifi, naturally) or read, or you can play one of their many games. The service was good and the rest of the menu looked enticing. Im sure I will come back to try the fries and a game or two! Maybe even open mic night?

Very nice ambience. Some of their paninis and coffees and soups are pretty good. For example the eggplant, mushroom panini is my favorite. The Chicken pesto panini is good too. however the menu is really small and I have exhausted all the items by now. Its one of my favorite hang out places very close to UMD campus. They also have board games (5$ per person) ??and nice artsy decor. Good place for a coffee date or hanging out with friends. Old bay fries are super tasty.

What a fun place!. Big shout out for using Vigilante as their coffee supplier - its roasted just down the road in Hyattsville, and is way fresher than *$$. My latte was excellent. I had the spicy pulled beef, which should come with a warning, as it is 3 out of 4 peppers on the Shophouse heat scale. Not a problem for this Thai and Korean fan, but might be for some. Fries were crispy and nicely seasoned. Very good quality, but I was not impressed by the quantity/price ratio. The big hurt here is parking, as College Park is almost as evil as DC on supply and enforcement. I dont know what the reviewer who suggested parking across the street was smoking, as there are tow warning signs galore.

This place is worth going out of your way for. ??A cafe with great coffee, tasty food, and I have the option of buying a craft beer? Yes, please.  They really nailed it when setting up this place. The decor is open and inviting. ??There are plenty of seating arrangements for people coming there to read a book, people watch the busy street outside, curl up on a comfy couch, and plenty of tables for playing the crazy amount of board games they have available.  Sometimes its really hard to find a low key spot to grab a drink with a friend. You dont quite want a bar and a restaurant is too formal. Problem solved - come here.  Looking for a place to have a game night? A lot of public locations are too noisy, dont want you there for a long period of time, or are not a fun location to be in with friends. Problem solved - come here.  They have table service that still needs a bit of work but the enthusiasm was there. ??I grabbed a sandwich and salad while here and it was really tasty. ??  I really hope this place keeps up the positive attitude, clean comfortable look, and great food/drink choices. ??I had such a great time here and hope this place sticks around for a long time!

We interrupt your regularly scheduled Yelp review to bring you this very important public announcement: DONT FORGET TO PAY FOR PARKING. OMFG. JUST DONT.   My first time here was for a super awkward first date where the guy 1) smelled strongly of BO and had sweaty palms (he wanted to compare hand sizes!), ??2) wanted to know what we should name our co-owned vineyard, 3) commented on how my nose wiggles when I (forcedly) smile, 4) nicknamed and called me several times by this nickname, and 5) didnt merely suggest but TOLD me to order the hot chocolate. 3 times. then actually ordered for me. [Insert Jumanji meme here] WHAT YEAR IS IT?!?!?!?! No thanks, Ill have some Rishi jasmine green tea instead. Suffice to say, I did not put in additional time at the meter after an hour and dippppppped out.  Thankfully, this did not deter me from coming here again-- this time with someone that made it past the first date! My brain wasnt on fight-or-flight/first date mode as we skipped hand-in-hand from the parking lot, riiiiiiiight past the parking meter (I was really eager to show off my whats-the-opposite-of-extensive vocabulary in Scrabble). After showing him my color recognition skills in Candyland (A childs first game!), he realized we didnt pay for parking. Skip to the part where I confirmed he wasnt joking about my car being gone and ended up handing over a $175 to ransom my baby from the towing company. FUDGSICLES. Goodbye, overpriced espadrilles I was eyeing, and F you, Varsity.  Anyway... for the stuff you actually came here for: - $5 game fee per person; unlimited games for the entire night, assuming its not cut short by realizing your car is gone. - Its fun to listen to the group of very intense peeps playing what I think is Dungeons &amp; Dragons (or something equally nerdy) towards the back of the cafe.  - They serve beer from Diamondback Brewery! GO TERPIESSSSS! - Good variety of tea; cant speak to the hot chocolate (refer to #5 of second paragraph). - SO MANY GAMES, THERE ARE. - Tasty-looking food menu!  Did you know One Night Werewolf is an awesome game? Dont think they have it here but go buy it because its awesome.

A solid 4.5 star cafe. Tons and tons of board games available. You can play board games with your buddies while eating some sandwiches or drinking beer! How awesome is that?! I tried their fried pickles, which I didnt like much. 4.5 stars due to food, but then again, food is NOT what this cafe is known for anyways. Highly recommended if in the College Park area. Good place to go definitely. Friendly employees who are knowledgeable about the board games. Wish this place was near my home. College park is about an hour south from my home - that is without the traffic, so its not like I can go there often.

This is a great place to come and play board games, drink coffee and eat food. Everything on their menu is delicious, I have tried a bunch of stuff and have not yet been disappointed. The coffee is great and their regular coffee is one of the best around. The idea here is awesome; come in with a group and spend all day playing games. The only major negative I have to say is that its $5 to play board games. If you only play one its kind of a waste of money, however if you plan to spend hours there, its great. The sound is also not the best. If there is any large group, which I was there when a large party showed up (not board and brews fault by any means), it was impossible to hear the people at my table-- which makes playing board games really hard. I definitely recommend coming in to try out some news game, they have SO many, and grab some food and drink.   I also forgot to mention that they have a decent beer list that is reasonably priced if you dont want coffee.  Also, the staff is usually excellent. Once in a while they can be slow, but they are also super friendly.

I almost gave two stars but that felt overly harsh. I went on a Sunday, school was not in session so it wasnt exactly busy. It was a hot summer day.....and it still felt like it inside...fix that AC guys.  I was excited about the prospect of breakfast all day - but i didnt get to eat - reasons forthcoming. The beer/wine list was short but good. My date and I sat and ordered beers and water.   We didnt play games - we were going to (although $10 for us to play connect four seemed a bit steep) but....we were overwhelmed by a ton of fruit flies. One or two would have been fine, but they were every where, it was super distracting. I decided to give up when multiple flies had died on and in my beer. I told the hostess, who seemed too busy to come to the table until i hunted her down, about it and she just sort of shrugged and didnt offer to get me another beer. Then we said hey, we will just take the check. We were charged for my beer with dead bugs in it.....and when i asked if that was necessary she made me feel like I was a horrible human being for not wanting to pay for a beer i didnt drink due to bugs.   Could have been solved if she just got be a fresh beer, I would have stayed...maybe...  but instead we went across the street to looneys and had happy hour price beer instead.  I probably wont return but...never say never I guess

The food is great but the delivery service is terrible! Every time I order my food to be delivered, it gets to my house extremely late. The food is always cold and there is no solution for this issue. Just today, I had to cancel my order because I waited over and hour and a half for my damn food. THAT NEVER CAME! Just pick up your food from here and fight the urge to go delivery. UGH!  UPDATE: The food came later. The driver was oblivious. This whole ordeal took 2 hours. The restaurant did nothing about it but cancel my order. Unbelievable. Changed my review to one star. What a mess!

One of the few breakfast places in College Park that uses Uber Eats, which is great. ??Ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and it was just ok. The bagel didnt taste very fresh..a little bit hard, and the sausage is super small in comparison to the size of the bagel. ??In the future, would probably order extra protein. ??An ok sandwich, but will probably try again.

I want to like this place more. And I feel like if I actually go there - rather then order delivery - then I will like it more. The other Yelpers pictures look cute and quaint and wonderful. Like somewhere to go on like a 3rd or 4th date. Somewhere where your sure you like the person and could comfortably sit in silence while you contemplate your next bord game move. But I cant speak to the place. So alas 3 stars is all I can give.   Ive ordered delivery a few times. Usually as I pour over a good book or work on take home work. Ive gotten the pretzel bites a couple times. They are a bit oily but delicious. I enjoy the red pepper dip that comes with it but I think its best with good ol yellow mustard.  The fried pickles as well as the French fries always come smooshy and soggy. But the fries look like theyve been double fried and once were amazingly hot and crunchy. Id try them again if I was there.   The burger is a medium and I personally like my burger a bit more done. But the burger was tasty and not dry. My favorite part is the bun. It can hold but to the obscene amount of mustard that I put on it. I told you good ol yellow mustard! So all in all I will try again but next time Ill go in.

Today is my first time here, and I like the spaciousness - it feels like a good place to study with large tables and outlets. The cold brew is also quite delicious and very reasonably priced (under $3).  The one downside, and you may not be sensitive to this as much as I am, is that there is a perpetual grease smell coming from the kitchen. I wanted to stay here for a few hours, but I am not sure I will be able to due to the smell. I tried to move around, but it seems like the smell is everywhere.

I ordered through seamless and lets just say with such great reviews I am very disappointed! I ordered turkey bacon with toast. Toast had no butter and was very dry. Please look at picture below. Lets just say I will never order from here again!!!!

I love this place! ??Theres plenty of parking, but yes, you need to pay. At least not DC parking prices.   I had a tasty Caramel latte that is regularly $4.79. ??However, it was free to me, thanks to a Yelp Check-in. The Sour Cherry Scone I bought to accompany it was Huge! ??I took part of it home. That was $3.99, not exactly college student cheap.   I had a comfy leather sofa to myself. It was relaxing, and Alice, my server was the best!

3.5 stars   This review is only for the food. We wanted a quick bite in college park and Bobbys &amp; Vegan food wasnt cutting it for me. Decided to try out board and brew with the awesome reviews...  Service was very friendly but the food took quite a while. We started with the fried pickles &amp; sliders for the little one... Not bad, fried pickles used a cornmeal batter which wasnt bad but not great. Sliders were a little on the dry side.   I got the chicken pesto panini which was good, bacon not necessary. The pickled onions was a nice touch to the sandwich. Boyfriend got the bbq beef sandwich - a little spicy but thats how he likes it.   Everything was OKAY, not amazing. I was slightly dissatisfied that my sweet fries didnt come how they looked in everyones photos/ I think they lacked either sugar or salt!

Omg omg omg soo good!!!!  Maybe its the coffee Im feeling right now as Im writing this excited review... SUCH good coffee, the caramel popcorn is delicious, the pancakes phenomenal, raspberry preserves flavorful... so perfect for gastronomic orgasm mid-morning or mid-day.   My usually talkative husband could not stop lolling his exclamations of how good everything was while eating it, but he did slow down to savor the coffee...

The Board and Brew is a cafe near University of Maryland College Park campus with a wide selection of card and board games that would appeal to all ages. They serve breakfast, small plates &amp; salads, sandwiches, desserts, and drinks (mainly soda, coffee, or tea). You have a choice of sitting at table with chairs or a coffee table with couches. I like the clean and spacious feel that cafe gives off. I also like how the cafes walls are decorated with local artwork (that can be purchased). I feel that it would be a great place to gather with friends and / or study and work productively.  Since my friends and I came from brunch, we only ordered specialty drinks (first one is on the house with check-in on Yelp) and desserts. For drinks, we ordered iced water, iced tea, creamsicle latte, earl grey italian soda, and brazil santa ines drip coffee. The Creamsicle Latte consisted of thai tea that was served hot and topped with orange infused whipped cream. It was certainly a interesting combo. Since our waitress said the cookies just came out of the oven, we decided to get three Chocolate Chip Cookies. The chocolate chip cookies were loaded with a generous amount of chocolate chips. Ill admit that it was a bit messy to eat and play at the same time, not to mention that the game pieces were a bit sticky already. Theres a $5 per person to play games for an unlimited amount of time. We had a fun time playing The Settlers of Catan. I like how you have the option to check out the games before you purchase them.

As cold tourists we were fulfilled from our dinner however we noticed this caf?? across the street and boy we were sure glad to swing by this gem. I simply feel like they dont make it like this anymore. Boardgames, food, and occasional live music. This is a necessity that every University needs.  Ambiance:  * Parking | There is garage parking, but could be a pretty packed place since its close to the University and other places to dine. * Seating | We came here on a Saturday evening during a football game and it was not too packed. The place can seat about 70 people and ranged from group settings to pairs. * Feels | I liked the modern alternative music, the vibes, and the board games. Definitely didnt imagine a restaurant with games. I just wished I stayed for an open mic session!  Food: Raspberry Mocha * Definitely stood out from other coffee shops. Sweet, warm, soothing, and delicious.  Customer Service: * Subtle high energy complimented with friendliness. They made our stay definitely warm and welcoming.  Overall:  * 5 stars. Ive been to many Universities (UCLA, Berkeley, Irvine, Washington) but never really seen a signature place like this. If so, it wasnt as visible and attracting. Any who the drinks were good, boardgames were fun, and the vibes were most warming. Kudos to The Board and Brew for being awesome.  TL; DR Tips: * $5 dollar charge per person for board games, unlimited time &amp; board games

I love this place. ??Its great to be able to play games in this relaxed friendly shop. ??The staff is knowledgeable about the wide selection of games. ??The fee for games is reasonable as long as you plan to stay for more than a couple hours. ??The menu for food and beverages is decent. ??Most of the food is pretty good. ??The menu choices have defintey expanded since my first visit (Ive been there 8 or 9 times now). ??Its great to be able to eat and play games at the same time. ??My once concern has been that the games would be messy due to the food, but Ive never had an issue with this. It must be a mix of good patrons taking care of the games and owners making sure to replace any damaged/greasy/soiled items. ??All of the games I have played have always been in great shape. ??No damaged, torn, or missing pieces.  Staff is friendly and attentive both in terms of service and assistance with games. If the server doesnt know the game they will find someone on staff who can assist with rules questions.  Awesome place. A great addition to College Park.

Yes!!! I would give this place 5 stars even if it was just the cafe, but the huge game selection made it ten times more awesome! The coffee is phenomenal, food and dessert were very good, and the wait staff were fun and friendly. Also just great atmosphere. Its 5$ a person to play games as long as you want, and before 4 on weekdays, its half price for gaming. But even if you dont do the games, its totally worth going. If we were local, wed be in here all the time.

Great fries, okay sandwiches. Good beer selection. Nice people. Most importantly: an enormous selection of amazing board games to play with friends (and strangers!).  Caverna? Yup. Twilight Imperium? Uh-huh. Codenames? Absolutely. Dominant Species? Never heard of it, but sure.  You got me, guys. Nicely done. Heres my wallet.

Ive come here quite a few times its always hit and miss depending on your server. The lack of consistency is why I give it three stars. The service is slow and its hard to get the staffs attention. Especially when its late. Some will stand around and just talk to each other. You may have to get up and go over to them if you need something. The food is decent. Theyve expanded their menu from when they first opened. Which is good. The sweet potato fries are great but now they charge extra for them. And last visit I had a breakfast bagel, egg, cheese and onions. Simple, right? Well they forgot the onions saying they didnt know how I wanted them. Why not come back and ask me how I wanted them? Why did I have to wave my hand wildly to inform them of that mistake. And also they didnt ask me how I wanted my bagel. I assumed it would be un-toasted. I was wrong.

I came to Board and Brew to play some boardgames. ??This place provided a nice low key Sunday Afternoon with some friends. ??If youre looking to get drunk, you can go to Boardroom in Dupont instead for that. ??Theyre only brewing coffee here. So If youre looking to geek out on boardgames, they have two large shelves with great variety.  While the boardgames are fun, service were great, and the owner friendly, the food was mostly mediocre. ??I ordered the Green eggs and Hamburger and a side of fried pickles. ??It sounds like a good concept...bacon, egg, and pesto on a burger. ??Not saying it wasnt enjoyable, but it was a bit one-note. ??I think that combination could work better with a nicely seasoned turkey burger instead. ??I tried one of my friends pretzel bites and those seemed like one of thr better choices, especially while playing games.  Overall, this is a good hangout spot for boardgames supplemented with food, but its not a foodies paradise. ??Perhaps if someone merged the concept with those Korean bakeries, that would be a good combo.

Frozen beef patty, soggy fries, very dry chocolate chip cookies. The only thing good was the canned soda.   Update: I was contacted by the owner regarding my review and I was highly impressed by his dedication towards customer satisfaction. I change my rating to 2 stars based on the owners personal touch and invitation to try this restaurant again.   I will try Board and Brew again and provide another review.

About the only bad thing I can say about this place is that it rekindled a love of the game Risk in me ??And now I find myself playing the online version of the game incessantly and find myself online playing it instead of on Yelp. ??So Board and Brew ruined my Yelping!  But beyond that, this might be one of the best places in the entire D.C. area to sit for a few hours and relax. ??At least if your idea of relaxation is challenging your friends and acquaintances to some of the best classic and modern board games in an alcohol free setting until the early hours of the morning on weekends (and pretty late on school nights too). ??I have seen groups of two to ten playing games of all types here. ??And not just gamer types but normal people too.  Personally, besides Risk, I found myself playing Battleship, the Lemony Snicket game (my ladys choice), and the Real Dumb Laws board game (a Trivial Pursuit game for libertarian types). ??There were some really complex games there as well that are set up to take hours (including what seemed like a dozen versions of Settlers of Catan). ??One thing they dont do here is teach how to play the games so unless youre very patient, some games here will not be for you.  One thing I do find incongruous is the quality of the food for a gamery. ??Im not going to argue with some incredible sides to munch on while gaming (the Old Bay fries are especially incredible as is the hummus plate). ??But as far as full dining goes, $10.00 for a relatively small panini seems a bit extreme.  For a huge group, splitting sides is cheap but as a dinner date, this place is not exactly wallet friendly. ??Parking is free in the lots on the Maryland campus on the weekends though so there is that. ??And the fun that can be had here is priceless!

good food and great atmosphere. would be a great place to hang out at if i was in college.

This spot is great. It has a very college campus vibe with UMD being so close, but that doesnt hurt the business by any means. In fact, this is a perfect spot for college kids to study and eat yummy food.   I have to say, when me and my boyfriend are in the mood for a relaxing morning with a delicious yet inexpensive meal, we always think of board and brew immediately. We love this place. Our favorite menu items that we order every single time include the bagel sandwiches, lattes, and of course THE best sweet potato fries in all of America. We are huge sweet potato fans, and let me tell you these fries are the best you will get. They are perfectly crunchy on the outside while still being soft and warm on the inside. They are to die for! The bagel sandwiches are also amazing by the way they grill them and how they cook the eggs. They are really hot every time they come out as well.   The food in general seems to be of good quality, which is surprising because you wouldnt expect that from first impressions. We also love their lattes, I always get a regular latte and the espresso and foam is really good, my bf gets the caramel latte and he loves it. We are also happy to see that board and brew serves a local roasting company in Hyattsville called Vigilante!   As for the board games, I will admit that we dont necessarily play the games there too often, but we did find out that we loved this one game there called Doodle Quest! We loved it so much that we bought the game ourselves. Though spending $5 for all day playing is a good deal. We spend at least and hour and half here every time we come and we try to snag a couch spot since those are so comfy! I know they serve craft beer here which may be of interest to some, though I dont drink much.   Overall, I do love this place, although, I will say Im not totally enthused by the ambiance nor the decor. I think they could revamp that aspect of the business a little bit. But the staff if very friendly and helpful and we have never had bad service here. If you are looking for inexpensive, yummy food with a relaxing vibe and perhaps the opportunity to play board games, definitely check out this place!

On a dark and rainy night, three tired Yelpers drove out to College Park, Maryland. In search of the infamous pink gem we traveled to find the location of the latest hidden gem restaurant. I was really glad that we found The Board and The Brew. The concept of a food restaurant that allows you to eat and play a variety of games is very novel. One of the owners, Brian, came out and greeted us. He answered our questions and made himself available for any others we came up with. The hot chocolate was rich and full of chocolate flavor. One member of our group had the pretzel appetizer. It was warm, soft and came with a delicious dipping sauce. The sweet potato fries were crunchy and fresh. The decor was warm and inviting. The wait staff was kind and attentive. I was told they have a professional gamer who will teach you how to play games that you are not familiar with. I am glad that we made the trip. We met another Yelper there and got our precious pink gem.

my last experience must have been some crazy fluke. ??ive been here so many times since then and the employees are all absolutely incredible, like i actually love them. ??trivia night is too lit (if you go, you have to get there early for seating) and the tea/coffee tastings are such unique lil events for college park. ??also, my brother and ??i are obsessed with their old bay fries. ??the jasmine tea is also out of this world, and you have to trust me on this because that single tea has made me a green tea convert. ??im a junior in college right now and my biggest mistake was not taking advantage of this place the last few years.

For the College Park neighborhood this is definitely a nice change of pace from the pizza and wings that dominate this college community. Please be aware this place caters more to college students, so if youre not into the 20-22 hipster crowd I would recommend ordering delivery through GrubHub. You will definitely have a different dine-in experience than when you order delivery. The guys here are great. The place is very spacious and feels more like a coffee shop than a restaurant. Very customer service oriented. The food is pretty good. My goto dish is the spicy BBQ sandwich. If youre in the College Park area and youre trying to find a place thats not super loud and has pretty descent food, I would recommend the Board and Brew,

Very awesome concept. My first legit board game cafe. Over 500 options of games to peruse and bring to your table.  Great date spot or place to hang out with friends in a spacious, clean, and super friendly board game cafe. I saw couples, groups of friends, families, and singles here-board and brew brings such a diversity of patrons.  Each person pays a $5 fee to play games here. There is a large set of bookcases in middle of cafe for you to play any board game you want. If you are a board game fanatic, and choose to bring your own board game, you and your guests must also pay $5 BTW.  Their is a great selection of food at reasonable prices. Chai tea was excellent, eggplant panini was OK (filling could have been more generous), old bay fries were crunchy. There were salads and desserts I am looking forward to try next time.   I liked the various seating options. Couches, tables spread around the room. The ceiling was super tall with exposed ducts, and there was ample room to play games and still hold a good conversation. I saw some people reading and studying and relaxing here so there are tons of activity options.   I really appreciated how the employees seemed really passionate about games as well and were attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend coming here for board games and fun over a good meal!  There are metered parking in the back of the Varsity building, where the cafe is located.

This is a great venue and I enjoyed myself. However the service is not the best. We had to wait over 15 minutes for our drinks ( I almost forgot what I ordered), we had to ask for condiments, our silverware and coffee creamer and sugar. Then when the waitress (probably a college student) dropped a fry in my beer and offered to bring me another beer (but it never came) I asked it be removed from my bill. However, b/c I had drank some of the beer, I was told only $2.50 would be removed from my bill. Now given the poor customer svc, at the very least they could hv done is remove the entire cost of the beer.

The old bay fries are amazing!  So many board games and good food and drinks.  The $5 fee per person for playing games is a little much.

I secretly like this place a lot! Not unique, not fancy, it doesnt have a huge menu, food is not super good but not under okay either, I have the feeling that the ingredients were well-thought, unlike most of the places around here.   Maybe the reason for me to visit this place so much is that I feel very comfortable here, and the staff is really nice. Also I must say that BBQ Beef Sandwich is very good and very spicy! (At least for a non-indian).   I am thinking they can improve the brownie a lot. Of course, everybody has different tastes , but If I was the cook for this place, I would start by removing the cream from the brownie. It is too much and different flavors of sweet with ice cream. ??Ice cream is ??more than enough to me! Also the brownie I would be very happy to eat would have a thin hard cake layer and slowly becomes liquidy from surface to center. Also I think they need to optimize the serving temperature for the brownie after a few experimental trials with some brownie rats.   Yes, I firmly believe that brownie is important for this kind of place. I like this place! No very specific reasons!

Come here for drinks and board games with friends! They have a huge wall of tons of board games you can pick from. The workers seem to know most of the games so if you want a recommendation, ask one of them! I think it was $5 for unlimited play.  Some nights they have open mic which is fun to have in the background. Def a chill place to be of you like to play games.

After our experience, the owner reached out and offered his apologies. We have not had a chance to come by and try their food again but I am confident things will be much better this time around. You can truly see how much the owner cares about his customers, and thats awesome. The fact that he reached out and invited us back speaks volumes. I am excited to try their food again!

Have only been once for breakfast and coffee. Service was excellent, and food was great and moderately priced. Will definitely go back. Games seem like a lot of fun for family and friends.

After a visit to Torontos Snakes and Lattes (the granddaddy of board game cafes), I realized Id never left a review for The Board and Brew. My biggest surprise upon visiting S&amp;L was I actually like TBB better! The game selection here is fantastic, and the games are in excellent shape (surprising given all the messy food being eaten). The food here is much better than S&amp;L, with the Old Bay fries as a stand out. Spending $5 for an evening of board gaming, with no pressure to order food or vacate your space, is an excellent value. I only wish I lived closer, or that there was a location in NoVA.

It was a very late night and there werent many options available for a delivery. I ordered the chicken pesto panini and it was pretty good but the sweet potato fries are just okay. I would try it again.

First of all I LOVE board games so this tickled me in my warm and fuzzy places. A cool lil spot in the Varsity@UM with good lattes and decent food. I crashed a bunch of strangers table &amp;got down on some Risk and a Ridiculously good game of Topple. I emerge Victorious. o/  Anyhoo my first time here and service was alright. The guy behind the counter seemed a tad frazzled but nice. I started with the spicy caramel pop -corn. Caramel corn, satisfyingly crunchy with like a dusting of cayenne pepper that gives it this awesome, sweet subtle burn which i REALLY enjoyed. I also had the brew burger which has a beef patty that wasnt all that seasoned, Swiss cheese, hummus and a tomato ragu sauce. It was a lil bizarre. The tomato sauce was cold so the hot and cold threw me off. It comes with fries and for a dollar more, you can upgrade to a specialty fry (sweet potato, old bay, etc) I had the old bay fries and they were delicious. Kinda reminded me of Hot in temperature Hot Fries (like the chips). Tasty. They have a decent beer list and the Hard Cider is really good. I had a creamsicle latte and it was very subtle. The flavors dont smack you in the face like I was secretly hoping it would, but it was an alright latte at a good temp, so no burnt tongues.   Overall I thought it was a cool lil place that I never wouldve seen if it werent for yelp. If you like board games in a VERY college kid setting, give it a go.

The idea of this place is fantastic. The staff were super friendly and the food was pretty good! awesome sweet potato chips!

Definitely a great place for nerds, geeks and board game enthusiasts alike. Come here at least 2-3 times a month, my boyfriend loves trying different coffees each time we go and theres a variety of both small plates to try or even bigger entr??es. The homemade hummus is my favorite and their burgers are delicious! Tons of board game options and staff is very helpful and nice for the most part. Have only had a few occasions where we either had slow service or gotten forgotten about but we had seated ourselves towards the back and honestly once you order your food and get a game going, theres not much else for staff to do =)

The burger was so tasteless that it was hard to eat. They need to add seasoning. At least salt and pepper. If they already do, then I suggest they add more. Still giving them 3 stars cause the food was prepared well despite the taste

Terrible service the guys taking orders cant get it together. I will never step foot in this place again. My wife left hungry because we never got our order. When I was done eating he said he would rush the order and 30 minutes later he came out to apologize . The sandwich never came out of the kitchen. We miss Starbucks .

Was in town for an event and to meet my nephew for lunch. I yelpd this spot basically based on location and reviews. So glad we picked this spot!  The ambiance was great.Hubby and son are game fans and Im such a foodie - so it was great for all of us!  We ordered the Soft Pretzel Bites, Beef Sliders, Pear Salad  [One of the BEST salads Ive ever had} and we topped it off with the Warm Brownie Sunday for dessert.  I was VERY pleased with the food, service and concept (enjoying your meal while playing your favorite board games)  Wished I lived closer :(

The ambiance and old bay fries at The Board and Brew won me over from the start. Its a great place to bring your laptop and notebooks for hours on end. The staff is attentive but not pushy. I rate the old bay fries best fries in College Park. The sweet potato fries are good, good chai tea lattes, good chicken caesar salad, awesome pita &amp; hummus...the fried pickles are OK. Ive never had fried pickles anywhere else so that was an experiment. The music they play ranges from 90s rock to hip-hop so its ok if you forget your headphones. Great study spot with great study snacks! ??  - Vbites

I have been so excited to try this place and I was so hoping it would be good... and it was great!  I walked in with my out-of-town visitors. We were greeted at the door by one of the owners, Ben. We told him we only had 1.5 hours, if he could please recommend a game. He did, and taught it to us at the table. We all ate and had a hot drink. He and Noah, the server, were attentive, friendly, and polite. Ben was very sociable and patient in teaching us to play.   The food was delicious. I had the fried pickles and a soy chai tea-- both superb. The pickles were not greasy, very lightly (pleasantly) battered, the aoli was very flavorful and well blended. The chai was better than Starbucks for sure (and I love Starbucks chai)-- not as sweet, more flavorful, very cinnamon-y.  Their game collection is impressive-- a great mix of classics and newer strategy / Eurogames. They have a good deal on for-sale games (10% off MSRP).  Since the babys arrival we havent been able to play much, and we havent been great about hosting game nights anymore. I think/hope well start coming here for game nights with friends and on dates. Thats the kind of nerds we are.  Great for vegetarians, great for us.

Hopefully this was just an anomaly but we found them to be absolutely not kid friendly tonight. Food was OK and overpriced. I would really like to give this place more stars but the service was pretty bad. The three stars is for the brilliance behind the Nutella shake.   They claim to let kids come in to play games for free on a one-to-one ratio with adults but gave us conflicting information about what the actual cost would be. Ended up paying over $60 for one adult and two children, not even counting how much we had to pay for parking!  I get that this is primarily a place for college students, however they could do much better at reaching the large audience in the area of families with young children by offering even just a few menu choices designed for kids in the five dollar range rather than having to drop $10 minimum for a cheeseburger thats much too large for younger children to eat. Please please please also improve how you communicate about the cost to come play games for children. Much too confusing as it stands now. Bonus if you could communicate with more clarity on your website in advance for where people can park.

Decent place. Would like to go there once in a while. The coffee is good. So are their paninis. Good place to do your work and have some snacks and coffee!

Awesome place to go on a date or engage with your family. A place that requires you to put down your phone and engage with those around you. I had a burger which was ok. My friend had a side of fries the serving size was huge! Definitely worth the cost!! I went on a Tuesday so it wasnt extra crowded. The wait staff was attentive and didnt hassle my friend and I to leave even as it was drawing near time to close. I would return and plan to return!

This place gets like...7 stars for the game selection and entry price, 4 stars for the food, and 2 stars for the service. The servers are always polite and friendly, but its nearly impossible to flag one down - and once you do, bringing out the food and drinks takes a very long time. Ive only been there for dinner events, so Im unsure how it is earlier on.  Trivia night is a lot of fun. Their alcohol selection is a bit wanting, but not terrible. Its generally fairly noisy, so I wouldnt recommend it for an intimate night out. Its a great place to relax and play with a group of friends, though.

I cant believe its taken me so long to write this review considering I go almost every weekend. The Board and Brew is probably my favorite place ever! Its a board game cafe with great coffee, excellent food and a library of over 600 board games. Be prepared to come in and stay for hours playing awesome games and eating delicious food while youre trouncing your friends. The staff is amazing - warm, friendly, super helpful (make sure to ask for the on staff game guru for help when learning a new board game). Food items I love: the soups and salads and so good, as are the old bay fries and the pretzel bites: their specialty lattes are a treat. I take my friends there often and we always have a great time! Highly, high recommended.

Great place! They have several options for single origin coffee. The chili was spicy and yumny. The eggs were okay.   Service is a little hit and miss but the overall atmosphere is fantastic. Great coffee. Great atmosphere.

The beer was bad the cider wonderful. They have a lot of breakfast food that goes well. The games are nice but of course you have to play those games. You can go there for all types of board games and gaming competition.

Definitely a fan of this place! With the quality of coffee or atmospheric places to work (outside my office) being rather disappointing at the UMD campus, this places was JUST what I was looking for. I found them after ordering something through grubhub. The food (a burger and sweet potatoe fries) was so delicious that I decided to check them out realtime.  The B&amp;B is just off campus and located in a nice bright space with high ceilings. They serve all meals of the day and on top of that delicious coffee. Their staff is friendly and helpful without being pushy: they really seem to enjoy their jobs :) The place is great for getting work done, enough outlets and seating as well as strong wifi. I think I will become a regular.

I went last night for their first opening mic night, on their second night of business. It was great!   The open mic night starts at 7 (with sign-up before that, mentioning in case you are a musician), but I wasnt able to get there until just after 7:30. At that point, it was packed! Luckily, a seat that a friend was reserving for someone else became available. When you go for one of the open mics, I recommend getting there early. If you dont see me yet, save me a seat! ;) The waitstaff did pretty well considering how busy it was on only their second night of business. They were friendly, helpful, and when the food was taking a while, our server checked in with us. She was very quick with the checks when asked for them, which helped balance the speed issue, but hopefully that will also improve with experience as the place is open longer.  The open mic night was awesome, too. There was a variety of styles of music, obviously a variety of experience levels with the musicians too but Id say 90% of them were Very Very Good and the other 10% were not bad and were quite entertaining. This is a weekly Tuesday night thing, and Ill be back for it again.  Ok, food and drink! I had two hot drinks throughout the evening. The creamsicle, house-made Thai tea syrup, steamed milk, and orange infused whipped cream, and the affogato. They were both very tasty. I sort of wish the Creamsicle had a little more tea flavor to it, but it was gone pretty quickly, so clearly I enjoyed it! I also had one of a friends sliders, notable for the house-made Mumba sauce and caramelized onions, and an order of pretzel bites, notable for the red pepper aioli sauce. Yum. I look forward to trying some more of their menu items soon. There are several vegetarian options, cold beverages, and several options for hot, non-desserty sorts of coffees as well, including a french press of coffee, which I think it pretty darn cool.  The board games are many! I didnt get a chance to play any last night, but there are SO MANY. It will be a great place to go hang out with a group of friends to play. This is not your old fridge full of 1970s board games missing pieces at a random coffee shop, yall. This is shelves full of awesome board games with so many themes and of so many types that I imagine even people who dont like board games could find one that interests them.

My review is based on the day I went. ??The business was offline for some reason and it sent the young college staff into a tizzy. ??Being offline meant that they had to hand write all the orders, use a calculator for the bills, and generally interact with the cook and patrons more often (I was asked what my order was about 5 times from 3 different servers). ??It was quite an experience and not at all enjoyable. ??I waited more than 10 minutes for a cup of tea. ??I had chosen my tea bag, so I was just waiting for a cup of hot water. ??When I finally got my tea, the tea bag was already in the hot water and brewing -- odd. ??I do not like my tea strong, so it was almost past my liking. ??I ordered the pancake breakfast - 2 over medium eggs, sausage, and pancakes. ??I wanted turkey sausage, and three staffers had to be consulted to confirm whether any of the meat choices were not pork. ??The menu did not specify this, but isnt that something you should know off the top of your head as a server?   One waiter did try to help my dining experience by offering me several games to play (for free) while I waited for my food. ??After a looong wait (and several apologies from the most senior waiter), I finally got my meal. ??The eggs were definitely not over medium; they were super runny like over easy. ??I was starving by then and just sopped it up with my pancakes. ??The rest of the meal was good. ??  But I couldnt fully enjoy my experience because in the background, there were frantic waitresses trying to figure out tax for patrons bills, and how to survive in a universe without the internet. ??Kinda haha funny, kinda sad. ??I know other people who have been to this restaurant (when the internet was working) and they had a much better experience. ??I think I would give this place another chance, but no time soon.  Saving grace - #YelpHiddenGems

Hate to be the one to do this, but what is WITH the fly issue here? ??Have gone twice this week- great concept, the servers are friendly and accommodating. Great vibe as well. However I could do nothing to escape the fly issue they are having. Im only here visiting for a week and it is the dead of summer so maybe this is unusual. ??Beer list was great and the food was very decent, but the cleanliness factor was really called into question.

Went to visit during their opening day  Food: Just got an Affogato to-go. First time having it, but Im pretty sure the ice cream isnt supposed to melt that fast. Ill probably ask for less/no whipped cream next time. Menu is simple with appetizing choices. [Menu photos posted]   Service: You can go straight to the cashier for take-out orders or sit down anywhere youd like (servers then come to you.) Everyone seemed quite new and inexperienced. Workers were very kind, open, and attentive though. Probably will get better in time.  Other: - Big space - Lots of couches and tables - A LOT of board games to play displayed on shelves - They have a little cubby slot under the table for the menus!  - They also have some baked goods and stuff by the cashier.   Planning to go back soon to try some of their food and other drinks once they get the hang of things. Hope they do well; I love board games!

Ive tried the coffee and a couple lunch dishes-- Im not really a board game person, unfortunately!   Their regular coffee is rather fruity, not like a more neutral coffee, which is fine sometimes but not for an everyday brew. Sometimes theyll run out and make coffee with Southpaw espresso, which is pretty good.   I like their Creamsicle Latte-- despite it sounding potentially too sweet and gross, its actually got a nice Thai iced tea syrup and a light, orangey whipped cream.   Lunch was all right. We tried the chicken pesto panini ($10) and I substituted onion fritters for fries (+$1). The panini itself was good; the chicken wasnt dry. The onion fritters were just little random fried onion bits... somehow I imagined they might be like little cakes? Thats what I assumed when I read fritters. They werent bad, just not what I expected. We also got the barbeque beef sandwich ($9.50) which was pretty yummy. The fries appear to be beer-battered were the best thing we had.   Im glad this is around for a different coffee and lunch option, though I wish it were easier to park and grab a drink before work in the mornings.

Ill go into more detail, but the food is great! ??I was surprised by that. ??  I hope to go back soon and explore the games, exciting to have a place nearby to relax.

While its the gaming that sets them apart, one should not overlook the coffee here, which is fantastic -- this is easily the best place to get coffee within walking distance of the University. I had a delicious cappuccino with nice, creamy foam (and good latte art). As others have noted, they are supplied by Vigilante Coffee down the road in Hyattsville.

This place has instantly become a favorite College Park spot for me and my boyfriend. ??We went last night, ordered two Blueberry Muffin Lattes and the pretzel bites dessert, all of which were incredibly delicious. ??The staff was very friendly, and our server was attentive without being the least bit overbearing. ??They have so many games to choose from, and all seem to be in relatively good condition. ??My only critique (and reason for the 4 star review, rather than the 5), is that the $5 per person price for game play seems a bit high to me. ??It would keep me an occasional visitor, rather than a frequent one. ??Having said that, they do have a student night on Mondays, in which game play is only $1 per person (much more reasonable), if $10 of food or drink is purchased.  Well definitely be back, but probably mostly on Mondays, as were poor students! ??:)

The games are fun and the appetizers are really good!!! They dont have any drink specials though and it costs $5/person to play games which can make going pricy... Be prepared to pay around $30 for a couple drinks, games and an appetizer.

I wish this had been here when I was still at UMD. It could be a seriously fantastic space for students and broader geeky community, and it sounds like Board and Brew is trying to engage with open mic and tournaments. So yay.  The service has some major hiccups. It definitely feels like most of the staff hasnt ever worked in service/food service before. No one was rude or anything, but there was some major miscommunication and delays. We had a large group, but almost every person in the joint came with a group. Its non-structured gameplay - if you come without a group, youre going to be pouting on a couch (and there were a couple of those). A decision needs to be made: waiter service or counter service? Wait service needs better training and clear assignments. Counter service would probably still need staff to deliver the burgers and salad, and there wont be as much patience with delay.   The food is fine. Its not great, but lounging playing games calls for coffee, fried pickles, and sandwiches or burgers. The coffee is bad. I will admit to being a little picky about my espresso especially, but it was really bitter. The one that came out with my friends affogato had a nice crema on the top, but without the ice cream, that would have been unpalatable. I ordered an iced coffee, which, similarly, without sugar would have been gross. It didnt come to the table with sugar; I had to ask for something to stir in.  The game selection is excellent, and the suggestion sheet for new/other options was full when we came in. As far as I can tell, it looked vaguely alphabetically organized between the IKEA cube shelves, with some re-shelving mess of the system. Multiple versions of games like Tsuro (regular and of the seas), Catan (Star Trek!), and Smallworld (regular, underworld) are available for players, and quite a few expansion boxes are on the shelf, too (everything for King of Tokyo, eg). If youre aiming for a specific game, though, and another table has it, youll have to find something else. The many-playered games were being selected fast on the night we played.  Parking at the View is a metered lot thats patrolled like a hawk by towing. You can park immediately behind the row of shops, though, and it takes away what would be a serious volume problem. $1.00 per hour of time, and you type in your shape number and pay a kiosk, then display the ticket.

Ive never had a bad meal here. All the sandwiches are great. Not pricy, just a little unreasonable for what you get. By lowering their prices to match DP Dough or chipotle, they could do better as a business.

This is a review for the delivery and the items I have ordered it was a cheeseburger and fries that was not very impressive and cold . However, am going to visit in person to play games and experience the atmosphere. Will update this review then.

Great place to socialize and meet cool new people . ??Their kitchen is also something to brag about , very tasty and good list of comfort food. Their fries are very addictive! Great find !

An any given night we feel the rating would be a solid 4. ??We had one guy from a small town in Eastern Oregon who gave it a -3 but a 4 due to flavor! The open mic night was Tuesday and it was awesome. Our brew burger was pink on middle and was supposed to be done done It was dang good though. ?? The staff is awesome and we would come again! Peace

Great coffee, food, and service. Definitely a place to check out when youre in the area and need a good pick me up. On the days I work from home, I bring my laptop to Board and Brew and work there. They also serve breakfast food all day, which is always a plus.

This place is awesome! Flavorful food, great laid back atmosphere and staff with great energy and service, Patrick especially. Highly recommended.

I am a recent transplant from Minneapolis, got here a few days ago and I saw this little gem on my way to the Metro stop. ??I decided to stop in, where I was greeted with large, open spaces, and a chipper staff. ??  I stepped up to the counter, ordered my drink (The Creamsicle, try it.) and went and sat down. ??My beverage was brought to me by the perky barista, I think his name was Brandon, and we chit chatted for a few moments. ??This place is just great, I think the business model is sound considering the environment. ??The food is all decently priced, and most importantly the people here seem to be having a fun time working here. ??Always a good sign.  Back in Minneapolis, I wish we had places like this. ??The gaming aspect of the place is perfectly reasonable, and they have a very LARGE collection of games (as I will post a pic of shortly). ??Very clean, nice bathrooms, and the crowd is fun.

Awesome place to start your morning or to chill during a rainy day and play some board games. Great music and a fun menu that is very good. Recommend the homemade oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches, make sure to get your sandwich on a scallion/cheddar biscuit. Definitely recommend for groups or just trying to kill time. Walking distance to Marylands athletic venues.

We ordered delivery through grub hub, they were out of cheese for one of the sandwiches but no big deal. Delivery came quick, and the food was good, up until the huge hair I found in mine. Yuck. Wear hair nets people!!! Needless to say I did not finish my food

This place was a SUPER present surprise. ??I walked in and thought It was going to be a order at the counter place and I really just wanted to sit down and have someone bring me food. ??So as I looked around a server grabbed me a table and from there it was AWESOME. ??Great food and the cider was just what I needed. ??They import dessert from an award winning chef and the coffee baristas are ON point. I have the buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. oh and they have breakfast ALL DAY

Unique place staffed by a fun, friendly staff. If youre new to the place, Brandon is a great game master who will take time to show you the best games in the house. Right now, he works Fri-Mon. He spent almost an hour teaching us two totally new games, which was fantastic. Mondays are dollar game nights which gets you access to all the boardgames in the place with a $10 purchase.  Their coffee is great and have comfortable seating, even some tables outside. Parking can be interesting with a paid garage in the back - but also some free parking across the street, on the street (2hr) and free parking at the CS lot at UMD after 4pm.

We been twice and its a cute place with great service and pretty good food. The French fries are to die for! I really liked the pear salad! Clearly coffee is their specialty. I havent had that yet, nor have I played any of the games, but hope to sometime.

This is my new favorite place to order delivery! I am a homebody that loves to order delivery from Grubhub and decided to take a chance on a new place Id never ordered from before. The first time I ordered, I got the cheeseburger and it was delicious! I was pleasantly surprised it was cooked to the temperature I requested because so many other restaurants will always overcook what was supposed to be a medium burger. Since then, Ive also ordered their breakfast (Yes, they deliver breakfast!!) that was also amazing and delicious! The pancake platter was well worth the price because it came with so much food! I have yet to order anything from here I wasnt extremely pleased with and that wasnt of top notch quality and taste.

I have a fairly decent boardgame collection myself, and so I was happy to hear that a boardgame cafe was coming to College Park. ??I finally got to check it out the other day and I had a great experience. ??B&amp;B has any game you could ask for: family games, deep strategy games, light filler games, Eurogames, American Games, etc. ??$5 per person is nothing when most of the great games take at least 45 min - 1 hr. ??I could stay here all day with my friends playing games thanks to the variety. ??  The only thing that I would like is if there were some kind of index for those who dont know that much about boardgames. ??Maybe something that listed single player games, 2-player games, large party games, beginner/casual vs. in depth games, etc. ??Maybe the title along with a brief description would help with game discovery. ??There might be something like this here, but I am not aware of it.

Went the other night. Had great food in a fun atmosphere. ??Amazing collection of games. ??They have trivia night too. Cant wait to go back.

What a cool concept! Live music and open mic nights while you come and sip coffee along with light bites! They have games galore and you can grab a bunch and just play the night away. My friends had the coffees and a blueberry mocha that they seemed to enjoy! I really enjoyed this concept. Definitely something different.

A welcome addition to college park! A big open space where you can a plethora of board games (for a $5 fee per person). They had a great selection of games but I passed on my visit. The lattes are prepared nicely, tasted a little weak, but maybe Im just tired. A lot of the flavors and specialities are super sweet: orange infused whipped cream and thai tea syrup cater to the undergrad crowd. They have good selection of snacks and desserts if youre his looking for munchies, along with a wide selection of beers on tap. I got the brew burger. The patty tasted good and caramelized onions and Swiss cheese have the classic and tasty savory flavor of a burger. The hummus adds a nice garlic punch and was great idea! The tomato ragut made the burger taste meatball sub like, which I didnt really think added much. The sandwich overall had a Mediterranean flavor profile, if they added a couple sliced cucumbers, dill, oregano, lemon juice and put it on a sesame bun or pita bread, I think they would have an amazing sandwich. Theyre currently offering is a combo of tasty ingredients, but doesnt make a lot of since its in combination. I got the burger with a side salad which was nice mix of field greens but a little over dressed with vinegar.  Im definitely looking to coming back with buds to play some games, probably with an order of oldbay fries. I wish they had the ol standbys like wings or nachos, theyre probably worried those dishes would dirty up a lot of games. Haha  Ten Rens tea, you have competition!   P.S. The local art is pretty nifty!

I graduated from UMD in 2010, so I generally dont go to places in College Park anymore. The Board and Brew, however, is my notable exception. I love this place and I wish I could go more often. The Board and Brew is FAR superior to similar gaming + food/drink places in DC and Baltimore. First off, Board and Brew has a MUCH larger game selection. Secondly, theres a guru there wholl expeditiously teach you how to play a new game. Thirdly, the guru is pretty gifted at picking out something new based on your current tastes (My BF and I loooove Hanabi now!) And lastly, the coffee/tea lattes are delectable. My only complaints: The food is ehhh and the food service can lag a bit. But, honestly the food is about what youd expect for the price, and you probably wont notice the slow service if youre playing games the whole time. Once again: Highly recommended....Even if youre not in college anymore. ;)

This place is like a board game heaven for any board game geek. I think when I was here a section of the place was an event of game makers who bring I their own games they created? Unsure. But Its definitely the best game place with the best selection. And Im not talking about stupid games like monopoly, life, candy land, etc... And oh big whoop, cards of humanity.. No! They have tons of real board games for board game geeks including the indie ones. It costs like five buck to rent as many games as you want for however long you stay there. So this place is smack in the middle of College Park so good location, parking sucks to find around here. Also its called Board and Brew... They serve coffee brews, not beers. I wish it were Beers. This places Service is decent. They are attentive on water refills but i dont know how attentive they are when it comes to food. The old bay fries are the best thing there, extra crispy. Everything else food wise isnt that great. Its mediocre. I got the Kyles Green Egg and Hamburger. I barely tasted the pesto. And back the the service idk if its the not recognizing food is ready or what but my burger was soggy as all hell underneath. It was kinda gross. But it was a decently cooked beef patty. The hummus is just hummus and pickled onions and its the my baby sized cup of it. Also I thought he would know that when I asked for ice cream I meant the ice cream parfait on the menu since I didnt see any option to only get ice cream. But he brought me out a cup of plain ice cream... The onion fritters are like a blooming onion deep fried but cut up into pieces with mambo sauce. It was okay. Super duper greasy but crispy. This place is definitely a fun place to be if youre into board games. Its by far the best one in the DC/MD/VA region. I highly recommend for the giant wall of games alone.

Weve been here several times since its walking distance from our office. The food is very reasonably priced and I love the idea of a place to play board games. Its got a great atmosphere! The food is generally good. My only complaint is the same complaint I have for most restaurants in College Park- the service is incredibly slow.

My husbands positive memories from our last trip to the Board and Brew indirectly influenced why we came back to the Board and Brew in College Park, Maryland for a second time. The Board and Brew has a decent section for a variety of games and the two games that my husband chose for us to play during our last visit was the Lost Cities Game (one of the cards to this game had an image of ??what looked like people making a deal and another players card where it looks like it symbolized the achievement of making it to the city of gold) and Munchkin Zombies ??(which one of the cards had a Voodoo Zombie card and a Nun card). ??Each game is $2.50 per person per game. Both the employees who interacted with my husband as he was choosing the first game and our server were polite and served our orders quickly. ??My husband liked his cinnamon flavored drink. I have the receipt in front of me which says a cin/car shake that was $5.29 but I do not want to wake up my husband from a peaceful sleep just to get the exact name of the drink. My husbands sweet nature predisposed him to offer some of the sweet bites (cinnamon and sugar ingredient combination) with a delish frosting. However, I was only able to take what was either one or two pieces (not because of the taste but because I had been full from the drinks and treats that I had). Naturally, my husband had some left to take home as a leftover. ??I only drink heavily alcoholic drinks very occasionally ??and/or in moderation(for spiritual and personal reasons) but I decided to have just one Henrys Hard Orange Soda as an ice cream float (good thing because it had %4.2 alcohol but was only 12 ounces) with a savory almond croissant.

Genius business model for their campus proximity. A late night coffee shop with a mix of cafe and lounge seating, light bites, an open mic night, and a diverse board game selection with few duplicates. It has the feel of having started from someones personal board game library, and Im totally okay with that. $5 for unlimited play will fund inventory upkeep. Staff were all friendly and ready with suggestions, and Jonnys already my favorite server; the red/green stick signal for table service is nicely executed. Id like to see some no-game table spots outside for when the weathers nice. Chai latte was a little heavy but hit the spot. Blueberry muffin latte isnt as sweet as the Tang-esque creamsicle latte, but both are fairly enjoyable. The panini press on breakfast bagels is cute, but I would have preferred even toasting to hide the average bagel quality, and more bagel options. Nutelly was too dessert-y for me, but the hummus on the brew burger paired with a patty cooked to order won me over. If the liquor license comes through, Ill be interested to see what beers they choose to carry. Future hit list: fried pickles, soft pretzel bites, pesto chicken panini, BBQ beef sandwich, portabello panini.

I love this place so so much. I think Ive come here about once every weekend since it opened.  First off, so... many.... board games. About 500? If youre a board game enthusiast you will not be disappointed.   Also, if youre a person who considers themselves a light gamer, they have more family-style games. The staff is more than willing to help teach you how to play games as well.  I was so excited for this board game cafe that they could have fed me anything and I would have been happy just to be surrounded by endless gaming. But the food is SOOOO good. I was pleasantly surprised. The sweet potato fries, the pesto chicken (with the pesto sauce made in house), the iced coffee, the desserts..I think I have tried every item on the menu.. and I love it all.   I just love this place, the vibes, the staff. The staff is great, the service is always attentive and prompt! Theyre really going for building more of a community rather then just solely being a business.

Great place! Every game imaginable! Excellent coffee and good food reasonably priced. Had the burger a hefty 1/2 pound for only $10 with fries. Great place to bring some friends.

This is the ideal place to hang out with friends or work. They have an awesome game collection. For me, the fact that they have all the Dominion expansions is the main reason I come here!! I was also pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food is give how inexpensive it is. The crew are very friendly, they are also very good at recommending games!

This is an update to my original review. ??I visited again and spoke, at length, with one of the owners to explain my frustration. ??He assured me that they are revamping their staff and hiring practices and replaced one of their chefs. ??  It looks like Board and Brew really cares about their customers and listens to their concerns. ??I can appreciate that in a business and I wish them the best of success.

Uh No. ??Limited menu, and not that good. ?? Went here yesterday to drop off my kid at UM and had lunch here, ??since it was rated pretty good here. ?? Big disappointment.  I ordered the BBQ sammich, ??came on a hamburger roll and it sucked. ??More like Steak Umms with bbq sauce added to it.   My little one, Dipter, ordered a egg sammich on a Bagel. ??The bagel was like a dunkin donut type, terrible.   The only good thing was the Caesar salad. ?? Waitress was fine.   Lastly, they charge $5 p/p to play the games - stay away.

Good light, clean, good service. My iced americano was the green, astringent style of espresso that Im not cool enough to enjoy but it was reasonably priced. The game selection is excellent. Ill be back to do work.

Games upon games upon games. Throw in some tasty sliders and youve made me happy, Board and Brew. If you could make your chai lattes stronger and hotter, I would be even more pleased. But I love the giant teacup it came in. $5 for unlimited board games is a decent deal of you stay long enough and try out a couple - which my boyfriend and I did. I also love the variety of seating: couches to lounge on, tables to work, etc. ??I hate the parking arrangement at that building but lots you pay for are pretty normal in college park. Ill definitely be back! It would be fun to bring a bigger group to game with, too.

I had a hard time deciding how to rate this place. ??Its great for a latte but not for the food. ??The brew burger and the chicken pesto lacks flavor. ??The old bay fries were good. ??I loved the blue berry latte. ??I would return for that and try more flavors. ??The concept is cute but its $5/ person to pay board games.

ONLY $5!! *Note: Even though they say $5 for a whole day of board games, youll have to pay $5 again if you leave but return later on the same day.  Came here for the first time with my friends on a late Sunday afternoon. Quiet, soft music playing in the background. Not very crowded, ample seating. Atmosphere is somewhat of a fusion of B&amp;N and Starbucks, except the shelves are filled with games and not books..but whos complaining? Serves food - limited menu with sandwiches, pastries, and coffees. Great way to spend a day relaxing indoors and hang with friends.

Came here a couple times with a couple friends.  Food: 3 Price/Value: 4 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5  Food: 3 The food is okay but overpriced. The Old Bay fries are addicting and are perfect to split if youre playing a game. Price/Value: 4 $5 to play as many games you want for the whole day, and their game selection is huge. Service: 5 Service is awesome! Theyll give you recommendations of games and even spend the time to sit with you and teach a new game! Atmosphere: 5 So chill - like a giant living room. The place is new and there are couches and large coffee tables.  Tips You Should Know: The service is set up so you can choose to not be bothered if youre in the middle of an intense game.  Would I recommend? Dont come for the food, come here to play games. If youre looking for a relaxing night, bring a small group of 4-5 and you can spend the whole night playing games.

Needed a casual bite to eat with friends and found this spot through Yelp reviews. The reason we were attracted to Board and Brew in the first place was because they have over 500 board games and we thought that would be a fun way to enjoy the evening with friends. Unfortunately when we sat down we noticed the sign that said $5/person for unlimited game usage. My guess is that they want to keep the games in good condition but $15 for three of us to play Cards Against Humanity for an hour wasnt worth it.   The service at Board and Brew is good but still improving. We were immediately welcomed when we arrived and told to sit anywhere wed like. Then enough time passed that we questioned whether or not we were suppose to order at the counter or ??had a server. Eventually our server came and he was incredibly nice and very attentive.   The best part about this place was there food which best put is simple and delicious. We started out with fried pickles that were nicely breaded in cornmeal and came with red pepper aioli. They were hot, tasty, not too greasy and paired very well with the aioli. For dinner myself and another friend had the Caprese Panini that came with a side salad. The bread was nicely crisped on the outside and did not get soggy (this is very important to me), the pesto was spot on and the moz was good. The tomatoes were interesting because I expected fresh but they were in fact a stewed sweet tomato mix. The side salad was a perfect side though and I put some of it on my sandwich. My other friend ordered the Caesar salad with chicken, which looked great and she had no complaints. We also order a side of Old Bay fries for the table which were really tasty.   All in all, this place was good but I wouldnt go out of my way to go here again. However, this place definitely seems like a great for bringing your laptop and getting some work done with a latte or milkshake in hand (as a lot of college students were doing around us).

Awesome place for a cup of anything they have, awesome fries, and good times. Though someone is always there hogging the Battleships

4.5 stars. ??The cafe has only been open for a little over 3 mos, so there are some wrinkles to iron out still (mostly in customer service as mentioned in many posts...not from want of trying though, every staff member that we encountered was very friendly).  I did not try any of the board games, though they seemed to have a wide selection for sale and for play. ??We did get to try a lot of the food and were very surprised that it was actually very good. ??The stand out here were the fries. ??Wow, it was way better than McDs. ??The trick was battering them, and the Old Bay was the icing on the cake. ??I also tried the regular fries and the potato fries, but the Old Bay were my favorite. ??Fried pickles were not so bad. ??Not as greasy as usual and the right amount of salty and sour. ??Also very good was the portobello panini which came with a delicious mixed green salad. ??Cinnamon and pear oatmeal was a little sweet for my taste, but perfect in texture. ??The mango and strawberry oatmeal was definitely sweeter, though good. ??Brownie and ice cream was rich. ??Jasmine latte (not on the menu) was also overly sweet, but I think this is due to my own palate. ??  What really stood out for me was that the prices were very reasonable, which makes sense; this is a college area after all. ??I would recommend coming here even if you werent interested in board games, b/c the food is good and such a great value. ??We were here during open mike night, and there were some really good musicians. ??I got a sense that the cafe was a part of the community...even saw one of the employees spend another hour after his shift playing a game with some of the customers.

Lovely place. A gem that was needed for a long time. I have tried their pop-corn, coffee, creamsicle latte, everything bagel with egg sandwich and fried pickle! Delicious! Love the ambience and the seating arrangement. I was impressed with the use of a simple straw to let your server know when you are ready to order! You turn the red part of the straw up if you dont want to be disturbed and turn the green part up if you are ready to order! That way, the server wont have to unnecessarily ask you the same question a billion times! One more thing, you cant beat the price!!  A place for all. Not just students. But families as well.  P.S. Impressive collection of board games!

Its a bit awkward to figure out how this works, but once you get over that, its a really cool setup. We sat for almost six hours - played Agricola, Castle Panic, and Galaxy Trucker. Had a great time. The food was very good too. The pear salad was good, the French fries were phenomenally perfect. The chicken pesto panini was a bit bland, but the hamburger was great. And when you tell them how you want your burger cooked, they actually listen. The coffee was generic, but the lattes were good. Our party sampled the chai and caramel. They have a cool system where you indicate whether you need service or not, as people tend to stay for long periods of time. Definitely a must try for any gamers in the area.

I went here tonight with a friend and had a great time! ??They really do have an amazing game selection. ??We didnt get a full meal, but the apps we got were good and Ill be trying more of the food next time.  The staff was really helpful and friendly, and the prices were super reasonable - $5 /person for all the games you can play, plus the food and drink was reasonably priced. ??This is not a place where you go to just have lunch (although you could) - its a place where you plan to spend a whole afternoon or evening playing games with friends.  I will definitely be back, thats for sure!

Surprisingly good! This little strip of the Varsity is usually where restaurants come to die (See: Maryland Smokehouse, Chidagos, Yogiberry, etc), but TB&amp;B actually fills the caf?? niche thats been missing for quite some time around here. Ill break it down.   Physical restaurant/Atmosphere/Concept: Pretty cool actually! Theres a counter for take-out and baked goods, and the kitchen is also visible. Ordering take-out and eating it there might be a smart option, though. The place should honestly be a fast-casual concept rather than waiter-serviced. Its not worth the extra few dollars to tip someone in a place like this. In fact Id be much less inclined to go for a $2-3 coffee and study there, rather than have to be waited on. Anyway, love the board game concept. Going to be a great place to go once the beer/wine is available.   Food/Drink: Actually very good. I say that very surprised. After the previous restaurants around here, I didnt have high expectations at all, but the BBQ sandwich &amp; fries were both great. The horseradish on the sandwich was too intense for me, but easily scraped off. Anna had the strawberry oatmeal, which came out cold unfortunately, and the lack of presentation made it look gross. However, despite this, it was still very tasty. The other options on the menu looked promising, so Ill be back to try them!   Staff: Everyone was very friendly, albeit entirely inexperienced. Our waiter was clearly new &amp; had never waited tables before. I personally think in that situation the person should be trained and be comfortable in their role before doing their job, but being a new restaurant I completely understand the lack of training.   All in all, a very promising place with a lot to look forward too. Not at all disappointed, and hopefully well be back soon after some adjustments to tack on another star!

Its a great place with many positive attributes: good coffee, great games, tasty food, and positive atmosphere.

Have always seen this place but never stopped in - finally tried it and will for sure be coming back. Ordered a la carte and enjoyed the fried pickles - batter was light and crunchy. My man friend had the sweet potatoes fries and gave them a thumbs up (and hes a sweet potato fry snob!) Cant wait to come back for breakfast and play some games.

What a fantastic concept! ??If you want to find out if someone is the right level of nerd, take him or her here on a date. ??The food is good and the staff is really motivated to find you the right kind of game. ??The system they developed to signal ask me if I want more food vs. leave me alone while I play board games is really clever.

What a great concept!  Went with friends of mine and had excellent friendly service, the board games were fun to play, and the staff were not hesitant to tell us their suggestions, and how to play!  Overall would come again and again, As Good as it Gets!

Cool atmosphere and fun to see/play different games. Food was ok. Had the pesto chicken sandwich and the dessert pretzel bites. Service was not great. Asked for water refills which took over 10 min and didnt get our coffee drinks till dessert but we ordered it at the beginning.

Love this place! We love coming to play different board games, staff is friendly and helpful and the food is good.

I happened to be in College Park and stopped by here -- such a great idea for a college town! There is a vast selection of games to choose from and the coffee selection is great too as well as some beer options. I love that there is an option other than bars for college students to enjoy. Our server, Rashid, was soooo entertaining and attentive. He even took the time to sit down and teach us a new game. There is a $5/ per person game fee which I feel is beyond reasonable. I would definitely stop by again if Im ever in College Park.

We went here for Trivia night on a cold snow day. The service was very good and they had a great game selection. However, menu wise they did not have a very big selection. We were happy to see there was a lot of drink options, but food wise was very limited. The menu pretty much exists of appetizers, salads, and a few sandwiches. The best part of the meal was the beer battered fries, however, I took about 5 bites of my BBQ sandwich only to find out it was extremely spicey and could not eat the rest of it. ??It took 2 sodas and a hot chocolate to cool off my mouth. ??We were also surprised how expensive our meal was, for only having two sandwiches and drinks. One thumb down, will probably not come back to eat, but to play board games.

This place is good for those who are just looking for a nice cafe. Although Im a huge fan of board games, I went there with a friend for the first time just to grab coffee and a light lunch. Imagine my joy when I found out they now offer homemade gluten-free bread. I thoroughly enjoyed their grilled-cheese sandwich dipped in thick yummy tomato basil sauce and the hot tea selection they had to offer. It did get a bit noisy every once in a while when a nearby table finished a game but it wasnt much worse than your standard cafe 99% of the time. Im definitely going back and probably to play board games next time. So glad to have a venue like this in my area now.

The caramel latte is so good, it is the perfect flavor of sweet and coffee. The old bay fries are delicious. The staff is always so pleasant and happy. Love this place.

This is a review of my first time here. I am a graduate student at UMD and am very happy to have a coffee shop (that stay open late) near campus. The space is nice (plenty of seating, outlets along most of the wall) and the wifi is fast. Ill review the coffee drinks and food options at a later date. (And, of course, there is a great selection of board games -- most people here are playing games in moderately large groups -- there is a moderate to high ambient noise level due to the game play.)

Good food; excellent coffee; board games. Plus where ??else are you going to go in College Park.

Great concept. ??The food is wonderful. ??The fries are a must order. ??The fried picked a are disappointing (corn batter, not bear batter as one would expect). Cant wait until summer when adults can take the place over!

Came here for open mic night on their second day in business, and had a great time! Love the concept of a board game cafe. They have an enormous library of board games - all the classics and many youve never heard of. If you want to play games, a flat $5 fee per person will be added to your check for unlimited gaming. But you dont have to play!  The food is great - theyve got a small but well-thought-out menu: small plates/appetizers like fried pickles, pretzel bites, sliders and more, a few salads, sandwiches, a burger, plus breakfast and dessert items. Great coffee - theyve got a few fancy espresso drinks, french press or regular coffee. I had a Blueberry Muffin Latte which was fairly sweet but a nice flavor (they make the syrup in-house). Id probably get an extra espresso shot in it next time. And go for the whipped cream - its the real stuff with an orange flavor. They dont have their liquor license yet, but theyre working on that. You can also grab food or coffee to go at the counter.  The staff was very friendly and handled a rather chaotic room impressively. Any kinks that I saw throughout the night seemed to be worked out quickly and with a smile.  There are plenty of tables - mostly 4-tops, but you can push tables together for a larger group. A few comfy couches as well. Theyll be having a weekly open mic night on Tuesdays - the first one was great. Well-run, nice sound system, great host, lots of talent and a welcoming environment. It did get a little loud between the music and enthusiastic gaming, but I dont think anyones coming here for a quiet night.  If you dont want to pay for parking at the Varsity lot, you can walk a bit from one of the college lots over the footbridge. They have a helpful parking map at <a href=/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmapsengine.google.com%2Fmap%2Fedit%3Fhl%3Den%26authuser%3D0%26mid%3Dz2lXHq5wtb2Q.k1mYrKyNl94M&amp;s=8006ad51e91c5cae9c2f0641577bdabdc543fcd18f781ca51a13832e6250c1ae rel=nofollow target=_blank>mapsengine.google.com/ma??</a>. Theres a couple lots off Campus Drive that are free after 4pm and on weekends.  This is not the place to bring your laptop and get work done (they dont have public wi-fi and I dont think they plan on offering it). They want to encourage people to socialize and have fun with the games. You will definitely find your inner child with some of these!  I look forward to spending a lot more time here with friends.

This place has surprisingly good food. ??New and clean. ??Only suggestion is the bathrooms should have paper towels. ??The orange cream steamer is delicious. ??Never been to any place like it with the eclectic board games and cafe feel.

Wow! ??This is without a doubt my favorite establishment in College Park! ??They have a fantastic selection of board games and make great recommendations, the food is very tasty, and they have a great system for making sure you get service when you want it but dont get your game interrupted more than necessary.

Great coffee and espresso drinks. Loved that I could pick my beans for the French press! Compotes for the Greek yogurt parfaits are outstanding (we tried strawberry mango and blueberry basil) - topped with crunchy and not too sweet granola, just the way it should be! Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. Glad we stopped in!

As a student at UMD, I was so excited to hear this place was going to open. Now that Ive checked it out, Im already excited to come back and play games. The food is great, has a chill atmosphere, and you can play unlimited games for $5. I would definitely recommend coming to the board and brew!

Great place. ??Naturally, you come for the board games--they have hundreds of games and the staff are very knowledgeable about how to play. ??But the food is surprisingly good, and so Ive found myself coming back again and again for the food. ??A great environment, stays open a lot later than most other places in the area, and very attentive wait staff makes this a great place for college students.

I love this restaurant. The menu options are fun and tasty. The board game selection is enormous! Never a dull moment if you visit with friends and it is a great hangout for families and college kids alike. My only critique is that when the restaurant is really busy it is very hard to keep track of who is waiting your table, which made me a little uncomfortable and confused. Overall, great place! Very unique.

Went with two friends to have lunch and play some games......loved the idea! ??Didnt read my Yelp before we went. ??Huge assortment of games but $5 PER PERSON to play?! ??Oh, and spend money on food? ??Caprese Panini was small and mushy for a steep price. ??Couldnt really tell that there was any mozzerella in it at all. ??Atmosphere was cold and felt empty. ??A great concept but they need to lower the price to play. ??We didnt play.....$15 to play a game?

Very cool place. Huge selection of board games, friendly and helpful staff, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.

This is a great place to hang out! The hot chocolate is great and I love the huge selection of board games.

Fantastic fun. Food was good, the Blueberry Muffin steamer is liquid heaven. The game selection is fantastic, and the games were in great shape. Ive been there during the day to study, during lunch for food, and during the evening for dates. Every experience was solid. Im so glad theyre in the neighborhood!

Great place, great staff. ?? The game selection is fabulous, the servers are polite, knowledgeable about the games and the menu, and not intrusive, and the $5 all you can play games is AMAZING. ??Their food is good, and I recommend the Old Bay fries. ??I wish it were closer to my house so I could go more often!

I had been excited to visit this place for awhile. I was excited to go in and grab some coffee and play some games. Although we did have fun... TWO of the employees were informed that we were there for the first time. Our waiter and the lady who sat us knew we were new. They watched us play a game and we ordered two coffees. When we received our check.. Which we thought would be 4$ and tax for our coffees we were taken back that the check was 14 plus tax. I get it that they want to make money so people dont just go in and play games.. But TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS there is a game fee. Im glad we brought enough money. We were just in the area and decided to go and get a quick coffee and play a game. That would have been extremely awkward if we didnt bring enough cash. So if youre going there... Just know there is a 5$ fee for every person playing a game. I would have liked to have been informed before I started playing. I dont like surprises and I probably wont go back for awhile because of that. It was unprofessional. Also the coffee was not good and the menu was limited. The end.
